Alongside several others who have met the same fate, they are forced to go on a quest to find a remedy to prevent ceremorphosis. Players choose from twelve [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character classes]] and customise their characters at the beginning of the game; they also select an [[Backstory|origin]] from several options. Through interacting with other characters, engaging in round-based combat against enemies, and making plot decisions, players determine not only their fate but also the fate of [[Faerûn]]. That determination is also impacted by the game\\'s dice roll mechanic where a player\\'s roll determines if the outcome of a character action is a success or failure.  \\n\\n\\'\\'Baldur\\'s Gate 3\\'\\' received critical acclaim, with praise for its gameplay, narrative, production quality and voice-acting performances.

Sceleritas Fel (Brian Bowles), a fiend and manservant to the Dark Urge, only appears if the player has chosen to create a Dark Urge character. Viconia DeVir (Jess Nesling), a drow cleric and Mother Superior serving Shar who is integral to Shadowheart\\'s storyline, previously appeared in \\'\\'Baldur\\'s Gate\\'\\' and appeared as a companion in \\'\\'Baldur\\'s Gate II: Shadows of Amn\\'\\' where she was voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].\\n\\n===Story===\\nThe protagonist wakes up inside a giant dimension-crossing [[illithid]] (mind flayer) flying ship. They are infected with a parasitic tadpole that enthrals and transforms people into illithids; however, the transformation does not happen, and the ship comes under attack from [[githyanki]] warriors riding red dragons. The mind flayer crew teleports the ship to the Nine Hells and are attacked by an army of Devils. The protagonist is freed during the fighting and steers the damaged ship to Faerûn, where it crashes. They encounter other survivors of the wreck, all likewise implanted with tadpoles.\\n\\nThe party seeks to remove their parasites through numerous avenues, all of which fail to provide a cure. They are saved from the tadpoles\\' overwhelming psychic force by a \"Dream Visitor\" inside Shadowheart\\'s mysterious prism, a device that is sought after by the githyanki. The protagonist then becomes involved in the fate of the Emerald Grove, where local druids and tiefling refugees face off against the goblin horde that worships a cult of the \"Absolute\". Once the party either sacks or saves the grove, they travel through the mountains or the Underdark to reach Moonrise Towers, a cultist stronghold, in search of a new cure.\\n\\nThe protagonist seeks sanctuary from the curse around Moonrise Towers in a tavern called the Last Light, held by a group of tiefling refugees, Flaming Fist conscripts and Harpers. General Ketheric Thorm, the reigning lord of Moonrise and Chosen of Myrkul, is using a relic named the \"Nightsong\" as an engine for his immortality. The party scours the depths of Moonrise in pursuit of the Nightsong, revealed to be Dame Aylin, a daughter of Selûne. After either slaying or freeing the Nightsong, the protagonist confronts Ketheric, as well as his cohorts—Orin the Red, the Chosen of Bhaal and Enver Gortash, the Chosen of Bane. Through their Netherstones and a mysterious crown, the triumvirate collectively controls the Absolute, revealed to be an Elder Brain, the ultimate form of the illithid race, and seeks to rule the Sword Coast by manipulating everyone infected with a tadpole. Orin and Gortash depart with the Elder Brain for Baldur\\'s Gate, while the protagonist defeats Ketheric and claims his Netherstone.\\n\\nThe protagonist arrives at Baldur\\'s Gate as Gortash and Orin attempt to pit them against the other, while the companions find closure for their personal quests. It is revealed that the \"Dream Visitor\" is, in fact, a visage taken by a renegade illithid called the Emperor, who resides within the prism and oversees the imprisonment of a powerful githyanki, Orpheus. Orpheus is the source of psionic resistance the party possesses against the Absolute, and the Emperor has been leveraging this in his favour. The protagonist eventually faces off against Gortash and Orin, assembling the Netherstones to subdue the Elder Brain. The Elder Brain, having anticipated the triumvirate and the protagonist\\'s every move, overpowers the party before the Emperor comes to the rescue.\\n\\nRealising that the Netherstones require an illithid wielder with Orpheus\\' powers to be effective, the protagonist either frees Orpheus and allows him to transform, which causes the Emperor to resign to his fate and join the Absolute, or has either the Emperor, a transformed Karlach or the player character consume Orpheus in order to see the mission through. After defeating the Elder Brain, the protagonist can choose to either kill it and every illithid tadpole with it, ending the threat forever, or betray their comrades and rule as the Absolute.\\n\\n== Development ==\\n{{see also|List of Dungeons & Dragons video games{{!}}List of \\'\\'Dungeons & Dragons\\'\\' video games}}\\n[[File:Swen Vincke 2018.png|alt=Portrait of Swen Vincke, Baldur\\'s Gate 3\\'s creative director.|thumb|[[Swen Vincke]], \\'\\'Baldur\\'s Gate 3\\'\\' director and Larian Studios founder]]\\nThe original \\'\\'Baldur\\'s Gate\\'\\' game was developed by [[BioWare]] and [[Black Isle Studios]], and published by [[Interplay Entertainment]] in 1998.

A partial version of the game was released in [[early access]] format for [[macOS]] and [[Windows]] in October 2020.

Alongside several others who have met the same fate, they are forced to go on a quest to find a remedy to prevent ceremorphosis. Players choose from twelve [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character classes]] and customise their characters at the beginning of the game; they also select an [[Backstory|origin]] from several options. Through interacting with other characters, engaging in round-based combat against enemies, and making plot decisions, players determine not only their fate but also the fate of [[Faerûn]]. That determination is also impacted by the game\\'s dice roll mechanic where a player\\'s roll determines if the outcome of a character action is a success or failure.  \\n\\n\\'\\'Baldur\\'s Gate 3\\'\\' received critical acclaim, with praise for its gameplay, narrative, production quality and voice-acting performances. It won many [[List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]] awards and became the first game that won GOTY awards at all five major video game award ceremonies at the [[Golden Joystick Award for Game of the Year|Golden Joystick Awards]], [[The Game Award for Game of the Year|The Game Awards]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bankhurst |first=Adam |date=8 December 2023 |title=The Game Awards 2023 Winners: The Full List |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2023-winners-the-full-list |access-date=15 December 2023 |work=[[IGN]] |language=en |archive-date=13 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231213104409/https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2023-winners-the-full-list |url-status=live }}</ref> the [[D.I.C.E.

Sceleritas Fel (Brian Bowles), a fiend and manservant to the Dark Urge, only appears if the player has chosen to create a Dark Urge character. Viconia DeVir (Jess Nesling), a drow cleric and Mother Superior serving Shar who is integral to Shadowheart\\'s storyline, previously appeared in \\'\\'Baldur\\'s Gate\\'\\' and appeared as a companion in \\'\\'Baldur\\'s Gate II: Shadows of Amn\\'\\' where she was voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].\\n\\n===Story===\\nThe protagonist wakes up inside a giant dimension-crossing [[illithid]] (mind flayer) flying ship. They are infected with a parasitic tadpole that enthrals and transforms people into illithids; however, the transformation does not happen, and the ship comes under attack from [[githyanki]] warriors riding red dragons. The mind flayer crew teleports the ship to the Nine Hells and are attacked by an army of Devils. The protagonist is freed during the fighting and steers the damaged ship to Faerûn, where it crashes. They encounter other survivors of the wreck, all likewise implanted with tadpoles.\\n\\nThe party seeks to remove their parasites through numerous avenues, all of which fail to provide a cure. They are saved from the tadpoles\\' overwhelming psychic force by a \"Dream Visitor\" inside Shadowheart\\'s mysterious prism, a device that is sought after by the githyanki. The protagonist then becomes involved in the fate of the Emerald Grove, where local druids and tiefling refugees face off against the goblin horde that worships a cult of the \"Absolute\". Once the party either sacks or saves the grove, they travel through the mountains or the Underdark to reach Moonrise Towers, a cultist stronghold, in search of a new cure.\\n\\nThe protagonist seeks sanctuary from the curse around Moonrise Towers in a tavern called the Last Light, held by a group of tiefling refugees, Flaming Fist conscripts and Harpers. General Ketheric Thorm, the reigning lord of Moonrise and Chosen of Myrkul, is using a relic named the \"Nightsong\" as an engine for his immortality. The party scours the depths of Moonrise in pursuit of the Nightsong, revealed to be Dame Aylin, a daughter of Selûne. After either slaying or freeing the Nightsong, the protagonist confronts Ketheric, as well as his cohorts—Orin the Red, the Chosen of Bhaal and Enver Gortash, the Chosen of Bane. Through their Netherstones and a mysterious crown, the triumvirate collectively controls the Absolute, revealed to be an Elder Brain, the ultimate form of the illithid race, and seeks to rule the Sword Coast by manipulating everyone infected with a tadpole. Orin and Gortash depart with the Elder Brain for Baldur\\'s Gate, while the protagonist defeats Ketheric and claims his Netherstone.\\n\\nThe protagonist arrives at Baldur\\'s Gate as Gortash and Orin attempt to pit them against the other, while the companions find closure for their personal quests. It is revealed that the \"Dream Visitor\" is, in fact, a visage taken by a renegade illithid called the Emperor, who resides within the prism and oversees the imprisonment of a powerful githyanki, Orpheus. Orpheus is the source of psionic resistance the party possesses against the Absolute, and the Emperor has been leveraging this in his favour. The protagonist eventually faces off against Gortash and Orin, assembling the Netherstones to subdue the Elder Brain. The Elder Brain, having anticipated the triumvirate and the protagonist\\'s every move, overpowers the party before the Emperor comes to the rescue.\\n\\nRealising that the Netherstones require an illithid wielder with Orpheus\\' powers to be effective, the protagonist either frees Orpheus and allows him to transform, which causes the Emperor to resign to his fate and join the Absolute, or has either the Emperor, a transformed Karlach or the player character consume Orpheus in order to see the mission through. After defeating the Elder Brain, the protagonist can choose to either kill it and every illithid tadpole with it, ending the threat forever, or betray their comrades and rule as the Absolute.\\n\\n== Development ==\\n{{see also|List of Dungeons & Dragons video games{{!}}List of \\'\\'Dungeons & Dragons\\'\\' video games}}\\n[[File:Swen Vincke 2018.png|alt=Portrait of Swen Vincke, Baldur\\'s Gate 3\\'s creative director.|thumb|[[Swen Vincke]], \\'\\'Baldur\\'s Gate 3\\'\\' director and Larian Studios founder]]\\nThe original \\'\\'Baldur\\'s Gate\\'\\' game was developed by [[BioWare]] and [[Black Isle Studios]], and published by [[Interplay Entertainment]] in 1998.
