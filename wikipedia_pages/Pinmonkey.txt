'''Pinmonkey''' was an American [[country music]] band from [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The band was formed in 2002 by Michael Reynolds (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), brothers Michael Jeffers (vocals, bass guitar) and Chad Jeffers ([[Dobro]], [[lap steel guitar]]), and Rick Schell (drums, vocals). The band released two albums in 2002: ''Speak No Evil'' independently, and ''[[Pinmonkey (album)|Pinmonkey]]'' via [[BNA Records]]. The latter produced two singles in "Barbed Wire and Roses" and a cover of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s "[[I Drove All Night]]", both of which charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Schell and Chad Jeffers both left in 2005, with Mike Crouch briefly replacing the former. After these membership changes, Pinmonkey released their third album ''[[Big Shiny Cars]]'' on [[Back Porch Records]] in 2006 before disbanding. Afterward, the Jeffers brothers became backing musicians for other artists, Schell joined [[Pure Prairie League]], and Reynolds released a solo album. Pinmonkey received general critical favor for Reynolds's singing voice, [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country rock]] influences, and the breadth of their [[cover song]] choices.

==Biography==
Pinmonkey was founded by Michael Reynolds (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Rick Schell (drums, vocals), Michael Jeffers (bass guitar, vocals), and Chad Jeffers ([[Dobro]], [[lap steel guitar]]), the latter two of whom are brothers.{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|page=282}} The Jeffers brothers are natives of [[Kingsport, Tennessee]], and had played in a band called the Habaneros, which was based out of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]], in the 1990s. Chad attended [[Belmont University]]; after graduating in 1994, he worked in the mail room of Starstruck Studios, a recording studio owned by [[Reba McEntire]], in addition to touring with [[the Wilkinsons]]. Rick Schell, a native of [[Homer, New York]], moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1993. He been hired by [[Steve Earle]] as a backing musician, which led to him also playing for [[Joy Lynn White]], [[Buddy Miller]], [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]], and [[Elizabeth Cook]].<ref name="drives"/><ref name="boldly"/> Michael Reynolds grew up in [[Natural Bridge, Virginia]].<ref name="boldly"/> His father's side of the family had several musicians who played [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and Reynolds himself sang in church as a child. He moved to Nashville after graduating high school, wanting to pursue a country music career.<ref name="drives"/> After working his first job at a [[McDonald's]] restaurant, he befriended Chad Jeffers in 1995.<ref name="boldly">{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1458300/pinmonkey-step-boldly-toward-bluegrass/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211205151209/http://www.cmt.com/news/1458300/pinmonkey-step-boldly-toward-bluegrass/ | url-status=dead | archive-date=December 5, 2021 | title=Pinmonkey Step Boldly Toward Bluegrass | work=CMT | date=October 23, 2002 | accessdate=November 20, 2018 | author=Craig Shelburne}}</ref> Reynolds went on to work various jobs in Nashville. He worked at a Nashville record store called Cat's, in addition to managing an attorney's office and working in the mail room of [[Capitol Records]]'s Nashville branch.<ref name="boldly"/><ref name="drives"/> Reynolds initially performed at various Nashville venues as a solo artist, as a means of promoting his songwriting, through the suggestion of another Cat's employee. However, he felt uncomfortable performing by himself and thus had Chad perform with him. As they both wanted a bass player, Chad's brother Michael joined the two. Rick Schell heard about Reynolds's music through connections the two had at the attorney's office, and the other three hired him to contribute on drums and [[sopranist]] harmony.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="drives"/>

===Musical career===
Once all four musicians were in place, they began performing at [[nightclub]]s around Nashville. Through connections Schell had made at the attorney's office, they hired Rick Alter as their manager.<ref name="drives"/> Originally, the four did not consider pursuing music full-time, and only performed when their schedules allowed it. However, due to positive fan reception, they chose to become a band. They were booked to play at a Nashville club called the Sutler, whose manager asked them to pick a name so the venue could advertise them.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/70374668/ | title=Pinmonkey: remember the name | work=The Index-Journal | date=December 8, 2002 | accessdate=October 31, 2002 | author=Paulette Flowers | pages=3C}}</ref> Reynolds chose "Pinmonkey" after a slang term for a [[pinsetter]], a person who resets [[bowling pins|pins]] in the game of [[bowling]].<ref name="drives"/><ref name="beyond">{{cite web | url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/concertreview2.asp?f=pinmonkey | title=Pinmonkey goes well beyond its name | publisher=Country Standard Time | accessdate=October 29, 2024 | author=Jeffrey B.

==Musical style==
Pinmonkey's sound combines a number of influences. Erik Hage of AllMusic wrote that Pinmonkey "boasts a heady blend of country/[[Americana music|Americana]] styles: traditional [[Southern gospel]], Appalachian folk, [[Carter Family]] harmonizing, Muscle Shoals pop-soul, and even traces of '70s rock."<ref name="allmusic"/> Remz called Reynolds's voice "a bit smooth...and heartfelt at the same time".<ref name="shiny"/> Leaver compared it favorably to that of Pure Prairie League vocalist [[Craig Fuller]],<ref name="leaver"/> a comparison also made by ''Billboard'' in their review of ''Speak No Evil'',<ref name="billboard speak"/> while Keefe found it similar to [[Jeff Hanna]] of [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]].<ref name="slant"/> Of his singing voice, Reynolds said, "everything I sing comes out [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]."<ref name="candy"/> In a concert review, Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time considered the band unusual for having a [[Dobro]] player instead of a lead guitarist, while also considering Reynolds's voice as strong in concert as it was on the albums.<ref name="beyond"/> In a review of ''Big Shiny Cars'' for ''[[Country Weekly]]'', Chris Neal described the band as having "crisp harmonies" and a "bracing [[country rock]] sound".<ref>{{cite journal | title=Reviews | author=Chris Neal | journal=Country Weekly | pages=56 | date=April 10, 2006}}</ref> Writing for the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', Greg Crawford thought the band's sound mixed bluegrass with 1970s country rock, also highlighting Reynolds's "soulful" voice and inclusion of Dobro in the arrangements. He thought the band's sound would appeal to fans of the then-[[The Chicks|Dixie Chicks]]'s ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/361666652/ | title=Reviews | work=Detroit Free Press | date=October 27, 2002 | accessdate=October 29, 2024 | author=Greg Crawford | pages=5J}}</ref> Keefe also spoke favorably of the inclusion of Dobro in the band's work.<ref name="slant"/>

Pinmonkey is also noted for their unconventional choice of [[cover song]]s. Reynolds recalled in an interview with Country Standard Time how the band came to cover a number of songs in various genres. According to him, Chad Jeffers suggested the "I Drove All Night" cover because his girlfriend at the time was a fan of Cyndi Lauper, and the band chose to listen to an acoustic recording made by Jeffers so that they could come up with a version not influenced by the original.<ref name="drives"/> Reynolds also said the band chose to cover Dolly Parton's "Falling Out of Love with Me" because he liked Parton's songwriting and wanted to cover one of her songs. Although he liked the song, he did not consider it suitable for Pinmonkey until Chad started singing it during a conversation.<ref name="drives">{{cite web | url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/print_article.asp?xid=690 | title=Pinmonkey drives on | publisher=Country Standard Time | accessdate=October 29, 2024 | author=Jeffrey B. Remz}}</ref> However, the band had not considered including it on the album until [[artists and repertoire]] representatives at BNA Records asked them to include a ballad.<ref name="drives"/> While the band's repertoire included relatively few original songs, Remz highlighted Reynolds's composition "Jar of Clay", noting that its lyrics about death showcased Pinmonkey's bluegrass influences.<ref name="drives"/> Keefe thought Pinmonkey's choices of cover songs were strong, particularly highlighting those of Robison and Berg, and that the original compositions "Shady Grove" and "Mountain Song" showed a [[newgrass]] influence, although he thought the range of cover song choices impacted the sequencing of ''Big Shiny Cars''.<ref name="slant"/>
