A canyon may also refer to a rift between two mountain peaks, such as those in ranges including the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Alps]], the [[Himalayas]] or the [[Andes]]. Usually, a river or stream carves out such splits between mountains. Examples of mountain-type canyons are [[Provo Canyon]] in Utah or [[Yosemite Valley]] in California's [[Sierra Nevada]]. Canyons within mountains, or gorges that have an opening on only one side, are called box canyons. [[Slot canyon]]s are very narrow canyons that often have smooth walls.

Steep-sided valleys in the [[seabed]] of the [[continental slope]] are referred to as [[submarine canyon]]s. Unlike canyons on land, submarine canyons are thought to be formed by [[turbidity current]]s and [[Submarine landslide|landslides]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Canyon sumidero entrada.jpg|thumb|[[Sumidero Canyon]], [[Mexico]]]]
The word ''canyon'' is Spanish in origin ({{Lang|es|cañón}},<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Canyon}}</ref> {{IPA|es|kaˈɲon|pron}}), with the same meaning. The word canyon is generally used in [[North America]], while the words ''gorge'' and ''[[ravine]]'' (French in origin) are used in [[Europe]] and [[Oceania]], though ''gorge'' and ''ravine'' are also used in some parts of North America. In the [[United States]], place names generally use ''canyon'' in the southwest (due to their proximity to [[Mexican Spanish|Spanish-speaking Mexico]]) and ''gorge'' in the northeast (which is closer to [[French Canada]]), with the rest of the country graduating between these two according to geography. In [[Canada]], a ''gorge'' is usually narrow while a ''ravine'' is more open and often wooded. The military-derived word ''[[defile (geography)|defile]]'' is occasionally used in the [[United Kingdom]]. In South Africa, ''kloof'' (in [[Krantzkloof Nature Reserve]]) is used along with ''canyon'' (as in [[Blyde River Canyon]]) and ''gorge'' (in [[Oribi Gorge]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title=kloof - definition of kloof in A Dictionary of South African English - DSAE |url=https://dsae.co.za/entry/kloof/e03913 |access-date=2024-08-06 |website=dsae.co.za}}</ref>

==Formation==
[[File:Kevo Canyon.JPG|thumb|Kevo Canyon in [[Utsjoki]], [[Finland]]]]
Most canyons were formed by a process of long-time [[erosion]] from a [[plateau]] or table-land level. The [[cliff]]s form because harder [[rock strata]] that are [[resistance (geology)|resistant]] to erosion and weathering remain exposed on the valley walls.

Canyons are much more common in arid areas than in wet areas because physical weathering has a more localized effect in arid zones. The wind and water from the river combine to erode and cut away less resistant materials such as [[shale]]s. The freezing and expansion of water also serves to help form canyons. Water seeps into cracks between the rocks and freezes, pushing the rocks apart and eventually causing large chunks to break off the canyon walls, in a process known as frost wedging.<ref>

 |title=The Geology of the Grand Canyon
 |access-date=2015-10-01
}}</ref> Canyon walls are often formed of resistant [[sandstone]]s or [[granite]].

[[File:Snake River Canyon Idaho 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Snake River Canyon (Idaho)|Snake River Canyon]], [[Idaho]]]]
Sometimes large rivers run through canyons as the result of gradual geological uplift. These are called [[entrenched river]]s, because they are unable to easily alter their course. In the United States, the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] and the [[Snake River]] in the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]] are two examples of [[tectonic uplift]].

Canyons often form in areas of [[limestone]] rock. As limestone is soluble to a certain extent, [[cave]] systems form in the rock. When a cave system collapses, a canyon is left, as in the [[Mendip Hills]] in [[Somerset]] and [[Yorkshire Dales]] in [[Yorkshire]], England.

===Box canyon===
{{For|the Colorado canyon|Box Canyon, Colorado}}
A '''box canyon''' is a small canyon that is generally shorter and narrower than a river canyon, with steep walls on three sides, allowing access and egress only through the mouth of the canyon. Box canyons were frequently used in the [[western United States]] as convenient corrals, with their entrances fenced.<ref name="encarta1">{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861686591/box_canyon.html |title=box canyon |date=2009 |publisher=Encarta World English Dictionary |access-date=2009-08-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217053643/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861686591/box_canyon.html |archive-date=2009-12-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Largest==

The definition of "largest canyon" is imprecise, because a canyon can be large by its depth, its length, or the total area of the canyon system. Also, the inaccessibility of the major canyons in the [[Himalaya]] contributes to their not being regarded as candidates for the biggest canyon. The definition of "deepest canyon" is similarly imprecise, especially if one includes mountain canyons, as well as canyons cut through relatively flat [[plateau]]s (which have a somewhat well-defined rim elevation).

The [[Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon]] (or Tsangpo Canyon), along the [[Yarlung Tsangpo|Yarlung Tsangpo River]] in [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]], is regarded by some as the deepest canyon in the world at {{Convert|5500|m}}. It is slightly longer than the [[Grand Canyon]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kepu.net.cn/english/canyon/hiking/hik301.html|title=China Virtual Museums: Canyon|website=Kepu.net}}</ref> Others consider the [[Kali Gandaki Gorge]] in midwest Nepal to be the deepest canyon, with a {{Convert|6400|m|adj=on}} difference between the level of the river and the peaks surrounding it.{{citation needed|date=August 2024}}

Vying for the deepest canyon in the Americas is the [[Cotahuasi Canyon]] and [[Colca Canyon]], in southern Peru. Both have been measured at over {{Convert|3500|m}} deep.

The [[Grand Canyon]] of northern [[Arizona]] in the United States, with an average depth of {{Convert|1600|m}} and a volume of {{Convert|4.17|e12m3|abbr=off}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/grca/parkmgmt/statistics.htm|title=Park Statistics|website=National Park Service|location=USA}}</ref> is one of the world's largest canyons. It was among the 28 finalists of the [[New7Wonders of Nature|New 7 Wonders of Nature]] worldwide poll. (Some referred to it as one of the [[Wonders of the World#Seven Natural Wonders of the World|seven natural wonders of the world]].)<ref>{{cite web|last=Truong|first=Alice|title=Everything About the Grand Canyon|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/adventure/everything-about-the-grand-canyon.html|publisher=Discovery Communications|access-date=5 February 2012|date=1 July 2011}}</ref>

The largest canyon in Europe is [[Tara River Canyon]].

The largest canyon in Africa is the [[Fish River Canyon]] in [[Namibia]].<ref name="birdfinder">{{cite book|author=Cohen, Callan|author2=Spottiswoode, Claire|author3=Rossouw, Jonathan|name-list-style=amp |date=2006|title=Southern African Birdfinder|isbn= 978-1-86872-725-4|page= 210|publisher=Penguin Random House South Africa }}</ref>

In August 2013, the discovery of [[Greenland]]'s [[Grand Canyon (Greenland)|Grand Canyon]] was reported, based on the analysis of data from [[Operation IceBridge]]. It is located under an ice sheet. At {{Convert|750|km}} long, it is believed to be the longest canyon in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/rocks-fossils/greenland-longest-canyon-discovered-130830.htm|title=Grand Canyon of Greenland Discovered under Ice|website=news.discovery.com|date=2017-05-10|access-date=2013-08-30|archive-date=2016-05-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511221221/http://news.discovery.com/earth/rocks-fossils/greenland-longest-canyon-discovered-130830.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Cultural significance==
Some canyons have notable cultural significance. Evidence of [[archaic humans]] has been discovered in Africa's [[Olduvai Gorge]]. In the southwestern United States, canyons are important [[archeology|archeologically]] because of the many [[cliff-dwelling]]s built in such areas, largely by the [[ancient Pueblo people]] who were their first inhabitants.
