==History==
Girls Next Door was founded in 1982 by record producer [[Tommy West (producer)|Tommy West]], best known for working with [[Jim Croce]]. West was a friend of [[session musician|session vocalist]] Doris King, and suggested that she form an all-female vocal group due to the concept being uncommon in country music at the time.<ref name="allmusic"/> The other members chosen for the group were Cindy Nixon, Diane Williams, and Tammy Stephens.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13053/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Girls Next Door biography |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |last=Brennan |first=Sandra |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> All four of the members had met through mutual connections at [[Opryland USA]], a former theme park in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which often employed musicians to perform there.<ref name="boro"/> They originally wanted to call themselves Belle and Wildflower, but after finding that other groups existed with those names, West suggested "Girls Next Door" after a song he wrote.<ref name="damon">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/106566698/ | title=New group closes in on success | work=The Anniston Star | agency=May 14, 1986 | accessdate=September 11, 2024 | author=Damon Adams | pages=10C}}</ref>

The four began rehearsing in Williams's basement and went on to record several songs with West. Despite not having a record deal at the time, they also began performing in local bars around Nashville. In 1984, the quartet was signed to [[MTM Records]], a record label division of actress [[Mary Tyler Moore]]'s [[MTM Enterprises]].<ref name="damon"/> MTM released the group's self-titled debut album ''[[The Girls Next Door (album)|The Girls Next Door]]'' in 1984, with West producing.<ref name="allmusic"/> It charted four singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. First was "Love Will Get You Through Times of No Money" at number fourteen, followed by their most successful, "[[Slow Boat to China]]" at number eight. "Baby I Want It" and "Walk Me in the Rain" were also issued as singles.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2017|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2017|page=142|isbn=978-0-89820-229-8}}</ref> Girls Next Door's second album ''What a Girl Next Door Could Do'' charted singles with its title track and "Easy to Find", but neither made top 40 on the country charts. A seventh single for MTM, "Love and Other Fairy Tales", was never put on an album due to MTM closing soon afterward.<ref name="whitburn"/>

In 1989, Girls Next Door signed with [[Atlantic Records]] for their third album ''How 'Bout Us'' under the production of Nelson Larkin.<ref name="allmusic"/> It charted the singles "He's Gotta Have Me" and "[[How 'Bout Us (song)|How 'Bout Us]]", a cover of [[Champaign (band)|Champaign]]'s 1981 single. These singles also failed to make top 40 on the country charts.<ref name="whitburn"/> Girls Next Door retired in 1991, after a performance on the talk show ''[[Nashville Now]]''. All four members stated at the time that they wanted to raise their families.<ref name="boro">{{cite web | url=https://boropulse.com/2023/11/girls-next-door-foursome-reunites-after-30-year-hiatus-country-vocal-group-set-for-new-chapter-with-release-of-girls-next-door-2-0/ | title=Girls Next Door Foursome Reunites After 30-Year Hiatus, Country Vocal Group Set for New Chapter With Release of Girls Next Door 2.0 | publisher=Boro Pulse | date=November 2, 2023 | accessdate=September 11, 2024}}</ref>
