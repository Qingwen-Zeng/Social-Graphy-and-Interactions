'''Britt Christina Marinette Lindberg''' (born 6 December 1950) is a Swedish [[journalist]] known internationally for her work as an actress and [[glamour model]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==Biography==
Lindberg grew up in a working-class home in [[Annedal]], [[Gothenburg]], together with her sister and three brothers.<ref name=videooze>Videooze, Number 8, 1996 (Cult-film magazine)</ref> She studied [[Latin]] at school, and planned to continue her studies after graduation in [[archeology|archaeology]].

==Modeling career==
Around 1968, in her final year of schooling (when she was 18 years old), Lindberg began posing nude for men's magazines, such as ''FIB aktuellt'' and ''Lektyr'', after having garnered some attention posing in swimsuits for Swedish newspapers.<ref name=dvdtimes>[http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=60739 Looking for Mushrooms with Christina Lindberg] www.dvdtimes.co.uk</ref> She later appeared in prominent men's magazines, such as ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' (UK), ''[[Playboy]]'' (U.S.), ''[[Lui]]'' (France) and ''[[Mayfair (magazine)|Mayfair]]'' (UK). Lindberg was "Penthouse Pet" for the June 1970 issue of ''Penthouse''.<ref name=penthouse>[http://www.penthousepets.net/penthousepets.php Penthouse Pets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121025653/http://www.penthousepets.net/penthousepets.php |date=21 November 2007 }} Penthousepets.net</ref>

==Film career==
Lindberg has appeared or starred in 26 feature films, most of which are [[erotica]], fictional [[Sexploitation film|sexploitation]] or [[Softcore pornography|softcore]] productions. Her first appearance in an American film, ''[[Maid in Sweden]]'' (1971) was filmed with a predominantly Swedish cast in her home country. Her first role in a Swedish film was in [[Jan Halldoff]]'s comedy ''[[Rötmånad]]'' (1970). The film was seen by over 250,000 Swedes, a record for the time, and went on to become a commercial success.<ref name=sfi>[http://www.svenskfilmdatabas.se/ Swedish Film Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125055306/http://www.svenskfilmdatabas.se/ |date=25 November 2006 }} Svenskfilmdatabas.se</ref> Her third film, ''[[Exponerad]]'' (1971), was released with a lot of hype at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] that year, and turned her into an international celebrity.<ref name=exponerad>Interviews with Lindberg and director on Swedish DVD-release of ''Exposed''</ref> As part of the marketing campaign for ''Exponerad'', Lindberg embarked on a promotional trip across Japan, which later resulted in an invitation to appear in Japanese films. There, she played a major supporting role in [[Norifumi Suzuki]]'s [[Pink film]] classic ''[[Sex & Fury]]'' (1973). 

A string of sexploitation films followed, many of which were filmed in Germany or Japan. In 1973, she starred as Madeleine in [[Bo A. Vibenius]]'s controversial film ''[[Thriller – A Cruel Picture|Thriller – en grym film]]'' (1973). Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] has expressed his admiration for both the film and Lindberg's performance,<ref name="tarantino">Tarantino interview by Tomohiro Machiyama in Movie Treasures Magazine</ref>{{verification needed|date=March 2022}} with Madeleine later serving as the basis for [[Daryl Hannah]]'s character [[Elle Driver]] in his ''[[Kill Bill]]'' series of films.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tarantino |first1=Quentin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RRmcAQAAQBAJ&dq=quentin+tarantino+interviews+revised+and+updated+one+eye&pg=PA120 |title=Quentin Tarantino: Interviews, Revised and Updated |last2=Peary |first2=Gerald |author-link2=Gerald Peary |date=2013 |publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]] |isbn=9781617038747 |page=120 |access-date=October 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220304234226/https://books.google.com/books?id=RRmcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA120&lpg=PA120&dq=quentin+tarantino+interviews+revised+and+updated+one+eye&source=bl&ots=omLR7by0PP&sig=ACfU3U1XJUFA9rT9LT2Qqv0Ssn9BPiYysg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjmmru5zK32AhUUJzQIHcIKBnoQ6AF6BAgoEAI#v=onepage&q=quentin%20tarantino%20interviews%20revised%20and%20updated%20one%20eye&f=false |archive-date=March 4, 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref> 

Lindberg did not like that nude pictures were getting more and more explicit and, during the filming of [[Gerard Damiano]]'s ''Flossie'' (AKA ''Natalie''—not to be confused with a 1974 film of the same name, which was directed by [[Mac Ahlberg]] and starred Marie Forså), in [[West Germany]], she left the set and returned home to Sweden. Damiano (who also directed the infamous ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'') persuaded Lindberg to leave because he knew that it was going to be a hardcore film. For several years, the German producer tried to bring her back, in an attempt to complete the film. According to Videooze (No. 8, 1996), about 1,000 meters of film had been shot by Damiano. Production ceased and never resumed.

After a long absence from acting, Lindberg appeared in the 2016 thriller ''Lindangens Park'', the 2018 horror movie ''Svart Cirkel'' (directed by Adrian Garcia Bogliano) and in the 2020 sci-fi feature ''Pandemonic''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/XgeRnB/christina-lindberg-gor-comeback--efter-tarantinos-hyllning|title = Christina Lindberg gör comeback – efter Tarantinos hyllning}}</ref>

==Post film career==
In her introduction to Daniel Ekeroth's book ''Swedish Sensationsfilms: A Clandestine History of Sex, Thrillers, and Kicker Cinema'', Christina Lindberg explains that after leaving exploitation films behind, she has been busy with numerous other projects. In 1972 she met future fiancé [[Bo Sehlberg]] and later started to work for his [[aviation]] magazine ''[[Flygrevyn]]''. When Sehlberg died in 2004, Lindberg took over ownership and the position as editor-in-chief of the magazine—which is the largest aviation magazine in Scandinavia. She has also produced an instructional video on how to pick and prepare mushrooms, ''Christinas Svampskola'', and is very passionate about preserving the Swedish wolf.<ref>Daniel Ekeroth: SWEDISH SENSATIONSFILMS: A Clandestine History of Sex, Thrillers, and Kicker Cinema, (Bazillion Points, 2011) {{ISBN|978-0-9796163-6-5}}.</ref> She made an attempt to enter the theater school [[Scenskolan]] in 1975 after having taken private lessons from [[Öllegård Wellton]], but failed after having passed two out of three tests.<ref name="dvdtimes2">[http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=60739] Lindberg interview by Greg Gilvear</ref> She continued posing and writing for men's magazines while studying journalism at [[Poppius]],<ref name=poppius>Interviews with Lindberg on Swedish DVD-release of Wide Open</ref> and she eventually established herself as a journalist.
