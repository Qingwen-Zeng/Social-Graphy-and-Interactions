'''Larry W. Campbell''' (born 28 February 1948) is a Canadian politician who was the 37th [[mayor]] of [[Vancouver]], Canada, from 2002 until 2005, and a member of the [[Senate of Canada]] from 2005 until his retirement in 2023.

Before he was mayor, Campbell worked for the RCMP as a police officer, and in 1969, he was transferred to the Vancouver detachment.<ref name = "bio">[http://www.larrycampbell.ca/biography.shtml Biography], larrycampbell.coa</ref> From 1973, he served as a member of the force's drug squad.<ref name = "bio"/>

Starting in 1981, Campbell worked for the Vancouver District Coroner's office and in 1996 was appointed BC Chief Coroner, a post in which he served until 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/campbell-larry-w/|title = Senate of Canada - Senator Larry W. Campbell|date = 11 October 2016}}</ref>

== Early career ==
Originally from Ontario and of [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent, after high school Campbell's grandfather found him a job digging ditches for [[coaxial cable]].<ref name="YouTube">Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/ElhjjEl3cKQ Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120315130530/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElhjjEl3cKQ&feature=youtu.be Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElhjjEl3cKQ |title=The War on Drugs Has Failed. Is Legalization the Answer? -- Closing Plenary |access-date=2012-11-12 |date=2012-03-09 |publisher=Rice University's Baker Institute}}
*{{cite web |title=The war on drugs has failed. Is legalization the answer? |url=http://bakerinstitute.org/events/the-war-on-drugs-has-failed-is-legalization-the-answer |website=Baker Institute for Public Policy}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Later he was a steel worker as a hand riveter in a boxcar plant in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]].  He joined the [[RCMP]] on a bet with a Hamilton municipal police officer.  He spent about three years in uniform, but did not like to issue traffic tickets.  He was transferred to the drug squad in Vancouver where he worked in street enforcement mainly regarding heroin, including undercover work.  He started a drug squad in [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]].  Throughout his RCMP tenure, he never laid a single [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] charge.<ref name="YouTube" />

After serving in the RCMP for 12 years, the provincial chief coroner told him that the new [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] would negatively impact his drug enforcement efforts and convinced him to become Vancouver's coroner.  During the emerging [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] pandemic, he became a strong advocate for progressive [[harm reduction]] policies, quipping that [[Needle-exchange programme|needle exchanges]] causing [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] "is like flies causing garbage".  He served for 20 years, retiring as chief coroner for the province.<ref name="YouTube" />

As the city's former chief [[coroner]], his life inspired a popular [[CBC Television]] drama called ''[[Da Vinci's Inquest]]''.<ref name = "bio"/> The show was later followed by a spinoff, ''[[Da Vinci's City Hall]]'', in which the Da Vinci character followed his real-life counterpart into politics.<ref>{{cite web|title=Da Vinci's City Hall - IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469239/|website=imdb.com|date=25 October 2005|publisher=Internet Movie Database|access-date=14 June 2016}}</ref> He was also one of several coroners who dismissed the murders of several indigenous women in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver between 1967 and 1985 as "unnatural and accidental."

== Mayor ==
Campbell was elected mayor in the [[2002 Vancouver municipal election]] as a member of the [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]], by a large margin of 58% to 30% for his nearest opponent.

Shortly after Campbell's election, divisions began to emerge within his COPE party between a centrist group, led by Campbell and a more [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] group.<ref>[https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=ff4c2caa-6e75-4be4-affb-66ed7f006bc8&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A4FV4-00K0-TWD4-02RJ-00000-00&pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A4FV4-00K0-TWD4-02RJ-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8370&pdteaserkey=sr7&pditab=allpods&ecomp=n7yk&earg=sr7&prid=8d3fbb41-27e7-4f2e-94ad-e63b570b5b1d Bula, Frances.

The media quickly dubbed the bloc the "COPE Light" councillors (in contrast to the "COPE Classic" councillors).<ref>[https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=ef03f341-1b5e-43d8-b97e-85e66620d151&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A4F1H-2JR0-TWD4-02BY-00000-00&pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A4F1H-2JR0-TWD4-02BY-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8370&pdteaserkey=sr7&pditab=allpods&ecomp=n7yk&earg=sr7&prid=6ed173f7-cce7-4329-968f-c887b209b9cb Bula, Frances.

== Senate ==
On 2 August 2005, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] announced Campbell's appointment by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] senator. Campbell completed his term as mayor before taking up his seat in the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]].

On 29 January 2014, Liberal Party leader [[Justin Trudeau]] announced all Liberal senators, including Campbell, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cudmore |first1=James |title=Liberal leader says senators not welcome in caucus {{!}} CBC News |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/justin-trudeau-removes-senators-from-liberal-caucus-1.2515273 |access-date=2019-01-30 |work=CBC |date=29 January 2014 |language=en}}</ref> According to Senate Opposition leader [[Jim Cowan|James Cowan]], the senators will still refer to themselves as Liberals even if they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus.<ref name=expuls>{{cite news|title=Trudeau's expulsion catches Liberal senators by surprise|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-to-boot-senators-from-liberal-caucus-in-bid-to-restore-senate-independence/article16567413/|access-date=2014-01-29|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=29 January 2014}}</ref>

On 6 April 2016, Campbell left the [[Senate Liberal Caucus]] to sit as an Independent and later joined the [[Independent Senators Group]].  On 4 November 2019, he joined the [[Canadian Senators Group]].<ref name="sen-canada-senators-list">{{cite web |title=Senators List |url=https://sencanada.ca/en/senators-list/ |website=Senate of Canada |date=September 2016 |access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref> On 24 October 2022, Campbell left the CSG to sit as a [[Independent politician|non-affiliated]] senator.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lapointe |first=Mike |date=2022-11-02 |title=Tannas joins Senate Internal Economy deputy chair slate |work=[[The Hill Times]] |url=https://www.hilltimes.com/story/2022/11/02/tannas-joins-senate-internal-economy-deputy-chair-slate/354485/ |access-date=2022-11-15 |quote=Senator Larry Campbell's decision to leave the Canadian Senators Group on Oct. 24}}</ref> Campbell remained an independent senator until 28 February 2023, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 75.
