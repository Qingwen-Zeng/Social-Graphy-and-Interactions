'''Brian Edward Kelley''' (born August 26, 1985) is an American musician, best known as a member of the [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]-based duo [[Florida Georgia Line]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridageorgialine.com/about/ |title=About |date=22 November 2013 |publisher=Florida Georgia Line |access-date=2015-07-21}}</ref> Kelley is from [[Ormond Beach, Florida]], and enjoyed playing sports and music growing up. He moved to Nashville to go to school and play baseball at [[Belmont University]],<ref name="Tyler Hubbard">{{cite web |url=http://bigloudshirt.com/writers-and-artists/tyler-hubbard-big-loud-mountain-writer |title=Tyler Hubbard |publisher=Big Loud Shirt |access-date=2015-07-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410105632/http://bigloudshirt.com/writers-and-artists/tyler-hubbard-big-loud-mountain-writer |archive-date=2015-04-10 }}</ref> where he met [[Tyler Hubbard]], the other member of Florida Georgia Line.

==Early life==
Kelley was born on August 26, 1985, in [[Ormond Beach, Florida]], and is the son of Ed and Mary Margaret Kelley.<ref name="Facts">{{cite web|url=http://flagaline.net/FGL/facts.html |title=Facts |publisher=Florida Georgia Line Net |access-date=2015-07-21}}</ref> Growing up, Kelley enjoyed sports and writing and spent most of his time playing baseball or at the beach.  As he got older he started to spend more time writing music and leading worship at his church.<ref name="answers">{{cite web |last1=Black |first1=Lauren |title=An In-Depth Look at Florida Georgia Line |url=http://countrymusic.answers.com/duos/an-in-depth-look-at-florida-georgia-line |website=Answers.com |access-date=21 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723110455/http://countrymusic.answers.com/duos/an-in-depth-look-at-florida-georgia-line |archive-date=23 July 2015 }}</ref> He also developed a strong love for playing guitar. When he was in his teens, his sister began to introduce him to country artists by playing him tapes on the way to the beach in exchange for Kelley washing her car. By the time Kelley was ready to graduate from [[Seabreeze High School]] in 2004 and Daytona State College in 2007, he was splitting his time between baseball (playing college baseball at [[Daytona State College]] and Florida State University and being scouted by the pros) and writing music. However, when he was doing more bench sitting than playing, he filled the void with writing. He later decided to move to [[Belmont University]].<ref name="Brian Kelley">{{cite web |url=http://bigloudshirt.com/writers-and-artists/brian-kelley-big-loud-mountain-writer |title=Brian Kelley |publisher=Big Loud Shirt |access-date=2015-07-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410105550/http://bigloudshirt.com/writers-and-artists/brian-kelley-big-loud-mountain-writer |archive-date=2015-04-10 }}</ref>

==Career==

===Florida Georgia Line (2010–2022)===
Kelley was introduced to [[Tyler Hubbard]] at Belmont University in 2007 while they were in a campus worship group together. The two became great friends, and began playing guitar and writing songs together.<ref name="Tyler Hubbard"/> The two friends began playing writers rounds throughout Nashville. In 2009, the duo decided they wanted to pursue music as a career so they started playing shows throughout the American South. In 2010, they independently recorded and digitally distributed their first EP, ''Anything Like Me''. After releasing that EP, they were discovered at a county fair by [[Nickelback]]'s producer, [[Joey Moi]]. After writing and polishing songs for two years, the duo released their second EP ''It'z Just What We Do'' in 2012. Major labels became interested in the duo when their debut single, "[[Cruise (song)|Cruise]]", first hit satellite radio on "''[[The Highway (Sirius XM)|The Highway]]''" channel and began selling well on [[iTunes]], leading to a record deal with [[Republic Nashville]] and [[Big Machine Records|Big Machine Label Group]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Parker|first=Eric T.|title=Florida Georgia Line Signs to Republic Nashville/BMLG|date=16 July 2012 |url=http://www.musicrow.com/2012/07/florida-georgia-line-signs-to-republic-nashvillebmlg/|publisher=MusicRow|access-date=July 21, 2015}}</ref>
