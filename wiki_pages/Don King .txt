King's career highlights include, among multiple other enterprises, promoting "[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]" and the "[[Thrilla in Manila]]". King has promoted some of the most prominent names in boxing, including [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[George Foreman]], [[Larry Holmes]], [[Tomasz Adamek]], [[Roberto Duran]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Chris Byrd]], [[John Ruiz]], [[Julio César Chávez]], [[Ricardo Mayorga]], [[Andrew Golota]], [[Bernard Hopkins]], [[Félix Trinidad]], [[Roy Jones Jr.]], [[Azumah Nelson]], [[Gerald McClellan]], [[Marco Antonio Barrera]], [[Salvador Sanchez]], [[Wilfred Benitez]], [[Wilfredo Gomez]] and [[Christy Martin (boxer)|Christy Martin]]. Some of these boxers sued him for allegedly defrauding them. Mike Tyson was quoted as saying, "He did more bad to black fighters than any white promoter ever in the history of boxing."<ref name="ESPN Classic - Only in America">{{Cite web |title=ESPN Classic - Only in America |url=http://www.espn.com/classic/biography/s/King_Don.html |access-date=2021-07-28 |website=www.espn.com}}</ref>

King has been charged with killing two people in incidents 13 years apart.

== Early life ==
King was born in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, where he attended school and graduated from [[John Adams High School (Ohio)|John Adams High]] in 1951.<ref>Williams, Bob. "Donald King's Mother Prays: God, Give Him Grace to Tell it all." ''Cleveland Call and Post'', November 16, 1957, pg. 1.</ref>

After dropping out of [[Kent State University]], he ran an illegal [[Bookmaker|bookmaking]] operation out of the basement of a record store on [[Kinsman Road]] and was charged with killing two men in incidents 13 years apart. The first was determined to be [[justifiable homicide]] after it was found that King shot Hillary Brown in the back and killed him while he was attempting to rob one of King's gambling houses in 1954. In 1967, King was convicted of [[First degree murder in the United States|second-degree murder]] for the second killing after he was found guilty of stomping to death an employee, Sam Garrett, who owed him $600.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

While he served his term at the [[Marion Correctional Institution (Ohio)|Marion Correctional Institution]], he began self-education; according to his own words, he read everything in the [[prison library]] he could get his hands on.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

Having been released in 1972, King was pardoned in 1983 by Ohio Governor [[Jim Rhodes]], with letters from [[Jesse Jackson]], [[Coretta Scott King]], [[George Voinovich]], [[Art Modell]], and [[Gabe Paul]], among others, being written in support of King.<ref name="nytimes pardoned">[https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/05/sports/sports-people-don-king-pardoned.html "SPORTS PEOPLE; Don King Pardoned"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 5, 1983.

== Career ==
[[File:Don King in 1982 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|180px|King in 1982]]
King entered the boxing world after convincing [[Muhammad Ali]] to box in a charity exhibition for a local hospital in Cleveland with the help of singer [[Lloyd Price]]. Early on, he formed a partnership with a local promoter named Don Elbaum, who already had a stable of fighters in Cleveland and years of experience in boxing. In 1974, King negotiated to promote a heavyweight championship fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in [[Zaire]], popularly known as "[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]".<ref name="telegraph1">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/usopen/2615095/Apple-Grapple-brings-a-gleam-to-Don-Kings-eye---Tennis.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=US Open: 'Apple Grapple' brings a gleam to Don King's eye.

King's rivals all sought to promote the bout, but King was able to secure the then-record $10 million purse through an arrangement with the government of Zaire.

King arranged Ali's [[Muhammad Ali vs. Chuck Wepner|1975 fight against journeyman Chuck Wepner]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Red|title=But Wasn't It a Bleedin' Shame?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/25/archives/but-wasnt-it-a-bleedin-shame.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 25, 1975|access-date=March 30, 2017}}</ref> It is widely believed the fight inspired [[Sylvester Stallone]] to write the screenplay for ''[[Rocky]]'' (1976).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Child|first1=Ben|title='Real-life Rocky' to sue over copycat film based on heavyweight contender's life|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/23/real-life-rocky-chuck-wepner-to-sue-over-copycat-heavyweight-biopic|website=theguardian|date=February 23, 2016|publisher=The Guardian|access-date=March 30, 2017}}</ref>

King solidified his position as one of boxing's preeminent promoters the following year with the third fight between Ali and [[Joe Frazier]] in [[Manila]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Only in America: The Life and Crimes of Don King (9780688101237): Jack Newfield: Books |isbn=0688101232 |last1=Newfield |first1=Jack |year=1995 |publisher=William Morrow }}</ref> the capital of the [[Philippines]], which King deemed the "[[Thrilla in Manila]]".<ref name="telegraph1" /> Aside from promoting the premier heavyweight fights of the 1970s, King was also busy expanding his boxing empire. Throughout the decade, he compiled an impressive roster of fighters, many of whom would finish their career with Hall of Fame credentials. Fighters including [[Larry Holmes]], [[Wilfred Benítez]], [[Roberto Durán]], [[Salvador Sánchez]], [[Wilfredo Gómez]], and [[Alexis Argüello]] would all fight under the Don King Productions promotional banner in the 1970s.

For the next two decades, King continued to be among boxing's most successful promoters. Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, Julio César Chávez, [[Aaron Pryor]], [[Bernard Hopkins]], [[Ricardo López (boxer)|Ricardo López]], Félix Trinidad, [[Terry Norris (boxer)|Terry Norris]], [[Carlos Zárate Serna|Carlos Zárate]], [[Azumah Nelson]], Andrew Gołota, [[Mike McCallum]], [[Gerald McClellan]], [[Meldrick Taylor]], Marco Antonio Barrera, [[Tomasz Adamek]], [[John Ruiz]], and [[Ricardo Mayorga]] are some of the boxers who chose King to promote many of their biggest fights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2008/01/54-facts-you-probably-dont-know-about-don-king/|title=54 Facts you probably don't know about Don King|work=Boxing News 24|date=January 14, 2008}}</ref>

== Lawsuits and prosecutions ==
===Links with organized crime===
King has been investigated for possible connections with [[organized crime]]. During a 1992 [[United States Senate|Senate]] investigation, King invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] when questioned about his connection to mobster [[John Gotti]].<ref>Finkelman, Paul.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6gbQHxb_P0QC&pg=RA2-PA99 Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present: From the Age of Segregation to the Twenty-First Century]'', Volume 1, p. 99 ([[Oxford University Press]], 2008).</ref>

When [[IBF]] president [[Robert W. "Bobby" Lee, Sr.]] was indicted for racketeering in 1999, King was not indicted, nor did he testify at Lee's trial, though prosecutors reportedly "called him an unindicted co-conspirator who was the principal beneficiary of Lee's machinations."<ref>[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/officials-want-promoters-out-of-ac/ ''CBS''] "Officials Want Promoters Out Of AC", ''CBSNews.com'', October 5, 2000. Retrieved September 9, 2018.</ref>

=== Muhammad Ali ===
King has been involved in many fraud litigation cases with boxers. In 1982, he was sued by [[Muhammad Ali]] for underpaying him $1.1 million for a fight with [[Larry Holmes]]. King called in an old friend of Ali, Jeremiah Shabazz, and handed him a suitcase containing $50,000 in cash and a letter ending Ali's lawsuit against King. He asked Shabazz to visit Ali (who was in the hospital due to his failing health) and get him to sign the letter and then give Ali the $50,000, and Ali signed it. The letter even gave King the right to promote any future Ali fights. According to Shabazz, "Ali was ailing by then and mumbling a lot. I guess he needed the money." Shabazz later regretted helping King. Ali's lawyer cried when he learned that Ali had ended the lawsuit without telling him.<ref>{{cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | pages=162–4}}</ref>

=== Larry Holmes ===
Larry Holmes has alleged that over the course of his career, King cheated him out of $10 million in fight purses, including claiming 25% of his purses as a hidden manager. Holmes says he received only $150,000 of a contracted $500,000 for his fight with [[Ken Norton]], and $50,000 of $200,000 for facing [[Earnie Shavers]], and claims King cut his purses for bouts with [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Randall "Tex" Cobb]], and [[Leon Spinks]], underpaying him $2 million, $700,000, and $250,000, respectively. Holmes sued King over the accounting and auditing for [[Larry Holmes vs. Gerry Cooney|the Gerry Cooney fight]], charging that he was underpaid by $2 to $3 million.<ref>{{cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | page=145}}</ref> Holmes sued King after King deducted a $300,000 'finder's fee' from his fight purse against [[Mike Tyson]]; Holmes settled for $150,000 and also signed a legal agreement pledging not to give any more negative information about King to reporters.<ref>{{cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | pages=147–8}}</ref>

=== Tim Witherspoon ===
[[Tim Witherspoon]] was threatened with being blackballed if he did not sign exclusive contracts with King and his stepson Carl. Not permitted to have his own lawyer present, he signed four "contracts of servitude" (according to [[Jack Newfield]]). One was an exclusive promotional contract with Don King, two were managerial contracts with Carl King, identical except one was "for show" that gave Carl King 33% of Witherspoon's purses and the other gave King a 50% share, more than is allowed by many boxing commissions. The fourth contract was completely blank.<ref>{{cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | pages=216–7}}</ref>

Other examples include Witherspoon being promised $150,000 for his fight with Larry Holmes but receiving only $52,750. King's son Carl took 50% of Witherspoon's purse, illegal under Nevada rules, and the WBC sanctioning fee was also deducted from his purse.<ref>{{cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | page=219}}</ref> He was forced to train at King's own training camp at Orwell, Ohio, instead of [[Muhammad Ali's Training Camp|Ali's Deer Lake camp]] which Ali allowed Witherspoon to use for free. For his fight with [[Greg Page (boxer)|Greg Page]] he received a net amount of $44,460 from his guaranteed purse of $250,000. King had deducted money for training expenses, sparring partners, fight and airplane tickets for his friends and family. Witherspoon was never paid a stipulated $100,000 for his training expenses and instead was billed $150 a day for using King's training camp. Carl King again received 50% of his purse, despite Don King Productions falsely claiming he had only been paid 33%.<ref>{{cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | pages=221–2}}</ref>  HBO paid King $1,700,000 for Witherspoon to fight [[Frank Bruno]]. Witherspoon got a purse of $500,000 but received only $90,000 after King's deductions. Carl King received $275,000.<ref>{{cite book | author=Newfield, Jack | title=The Life and Crimes of Don King: The Shame of Boxing in America| publisher=William Morrow| year=1995| isbn=978-0-9740201-0-5 | page=231}}</ref> In 1987, Witherspoon sued King for $25 million in damages. He eventually settled for $1 million out of court.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/15/sports/sports-of-the-times-trickeration-trial-of-promoter-don-king.html|title=Sports of The Times;'Trickeration' Trial Of Promoter Don King|date=October 15, 1995|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

=== Mike Tyson ===
Former undisputed World Heavyweight Boxing Champion [[Mike Tyson]] has described King, his former promoter, as "ruthless", "deplorable", and "greedy".<ref name="Tyson">Tyson (film), 2008</ref> In 1998, Tyson sued King for $100 million, alleging that the boxing promoter had cheated him out of millions over more than a decade.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n17_v93/ai_21237706/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708130821/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n17_v93/ai_21237706/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2012 |work=Jet |title=Mike Tyson files $100 million lawsuit against boxing promoter Don King |year=1998 }}</ref> The lawsuit was later settled out of court, with Tyson receiving $14 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5298011/|title=NBC Sports|access-date=December 5, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215040819/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/5298011/|archive-date=December 15, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Terry Norris ===
In 1996, [[Terry Norris (boxer)|Terry Norris]] sued King, alleging that King had stolen money from him and conspired with his manager to underpay him for fights. The case went to trial, but King settled out of court for $7.5 million in 2003. King also acceded to Norris's demand that the settlement be made public.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/11/sports/boxing-king-to-pay-7.5-million-to-norris.html|title=King to Pay $7.5 Million To Norris|date=December 11, 2003|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-dec-14-sp-dogking14-story.html|title=Is King's Run as 'Teflon Don' Over?|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 14, 2003 }}</ref>

=== ESPN ===
[[File:Don king.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|King at Madison Square Garden in October 2001]]
In 2005, King launched a $2.5 billion defamation suit against the [[Walt Disney Pictures]]–owned [[ESPN]], the makers of ''[[SportsCentury]]'', after a documentary alleged that King had "killed, not once, but twice", threatened to break [[Larry Holmes]]' legs, had a hospital invest in a film that was never made, cheated [[Meldrick Taylor]] out of $1 million, and then threatened to have Taylor killed. Though the documentary repeated many claims that were already made, King said he had now had enough. King's attorney said "It was slanted to show Don in the worst way. It was one-sided from day one, Don is a strong man, but he has been hurt by this."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=1965165 |title=Promoter takes issue with ''SportsCentury'' piece |publisher=[[ESPN]] |agency=ESPN.com news services |date=January 13, 2005 |access-date=July 2, 2015}}</ref>

The case was dismissed on [[summary judgment]] with a finding that King could not show "actual malice" from the defendants, and that King had failed to prove that any of the challenged statements were false. The judgment also pointed out that the studio had tried on a number of occasions to interview King for the documentary, but he had declined; while not suggesting that King had a legal obligation to do so, the court sympathized with ESPN's circumstances on those grounds. King appealed the decision and, 3 years later, the Second District Court of Appeals upheld the summary judgment, but disagreed with the original finding that none of the statements were false. In any case, Judge Dorian Damoorgian ruled, "Nothing in the record shows that ESPN purposefully made false statements about King in order to bolster the theme of the program or to inflict harm on King".<ref>{{cite news |first=Eriq |last=Gardner |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-espn-idUSTRE66601G20100707 |work=Reuters |title=ESPN scores TKO against Don King defamation lawsuit |date=July 6, 2010 |access-date=July 2, 2015 |archive-date=July 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702144502/http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/07/us-espn-idUSTRE66601G20100707 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Donald Trump ===
On September 21, 2016, King caused controversy when introducing [[Donald Trump]] at a [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|campaign]] event at a black church in [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] by using the word "[[nigga]]" seemingly by accident. In King's speech, he expressed his view that black people cannot achieve success in the United States by acting like white people, stating: "If you're poor, you are a poor negro -- I would use the n-word -- but if you're rich, you are a rich negro. If you are intelligent, intellectual, you are intellectual negro.
