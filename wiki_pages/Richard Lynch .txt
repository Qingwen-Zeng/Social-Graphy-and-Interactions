Richard Lynch served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] for four years.<ref name="obit"/> 

Lynch's distinct scarred appearance made him a popular nemesis, and he can be seen in more than 160 film and television performances. The scars came from a 1967 incident in New York's [[Central Park]] in which, under the influence of drugs, he set himself on fire, burning more than 70% of his body.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lynch Got Second Chance|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_gAsAAAAIBAJ&pg=2495,2878632&dq=richard-lynch+actor&hl=en|newspaper=Times Daily (Florence, Alabama)|date=March 17, 1971|access-date=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507054400/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_gAsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3McEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2495,2878632&dq=richard-lynch+actor&hl=en|archive-date=May 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> He spent a year in recovery, gave up drug use and ultimately began training at [[The Actors Studio]] and at the [[HB Studio]]. In 1970, he co-starred with [[Robert De Niro]], [[Sally Kirkland]] and [[Diane Ladd]] in the short-lived off-Broadway play ''One Night Stands of a Noisy Passenger,'' written by [[Shelley Winters]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://iobdb.com/Production/5407|title=One Night Stands of a Noisy Passenger - Lortel Archives|website=iobdb.com|access-date=July 22, 2019}}</ref> He often played a villain in features, including ''[[Scarecrow (1973 film)|Scarecrow]]'', which marked his film debut, ''[[The Seven-Ups]]'', ''[[Bad Dreams (film)|Bad Dreams]]'', ''[[The Sword and the Sorcerer]]'', and ''[[Little Nikita]]''.

In 1982, Lynch won a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as the evil King Cromwell in ''[[The Sword and the Sorcerer]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html#filmsuportactror | title = Past Saturn Awards | website = [[Saturn Award]]s | via = www.saturnawards.org | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100209012608/http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html | archive-date = 2010-02-09 | access-date = February 5, 2008}}</ref> Although Richard Lynch is best known for playing villains, he was cast as the president of the United States in the 2007 film ''[[Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy]]''.<ref name="popmatters">{{Cite web | url = https://www.popmatters.com/mil-mascaras-resurrection-2496110479.html | title = Mil Mascaras: Resurrection (2007) | last = Gibron | first = Bill | date = October 23, 2008 | website = [[PopMatters]] | access-date = July 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name="mjsimpson">{{cite web | url = http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/reviews/milmascarasresurrection.html | title = Mil Mascaras: Resurrection | last = Simpson | first = MJ | website = MJSimpson.co.uk | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090123115026/http://www.mjsimpson.co.uk/reviews/milmascarasresurrection.html | archive-date = 2009-01-23 | url-status = usurped}}</ref> Lynch starred alongside [[Judson Scott]] in the 1982 short-lived science fiction TV series ''[[The Phoenix (1982 TV series)|The Phoenix]]''.

In addition to acting, Lynch was a musician, and he played the saxophone, guitar, piano, and flute. He held Irish citizenship through his Irish-born parents and was a frequent visitor to Ireland. He starred together with brother Barry in the films ''Nightforce'' and ''Total Force''. Lynch's wife Lily starred with him in the film ''Breaking the Silence'' (1998) and son Christopher Lynch appeared with him in the science fiction film ''[[Trancers II]]''. In 1977, Richard Lynch shared the stage with actor Al Pacino, a close friend, in the Broadway play ''The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel.'' Lynch played a Vietnam veteran who used a wheelchair, and was nominated for a Tony in 1977.

Through the years, Lynch worked with friend and colleague [[Don Calfa]] in the films ''Necronomicon'' (1993), ''Toughguy'' (1995), ''[[Corpses Are Forever]]'' (2003), and ''Lewisburg'' (2009).

==Later life and death==
Lynch married twice — once to Béatrix Lynch (their son Christopher died in 2005 from [[pneumonia]]), and later to Lily Lynch.<ref>{{Cite magazine | url = https://variety.com/2012/film/news/actor-richard-lynch-dies-at-76-1118055789/ | title = Actor Richard Lynch dies at 76 | agency = [[Associated Press]] | date = June 20, 2012 | magazine = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | access-date = July 22, 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180714150851/https://variety.com/2012/film/news/actor-richard-lynch-dies-at-76-1118055789/ | archive-date = July 14, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref>
