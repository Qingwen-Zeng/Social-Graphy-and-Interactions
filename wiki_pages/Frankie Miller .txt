==Career==

===1966–1972: Early career===
Miller began singing professionally as a teenager with a [[Glasgow]] band called The Stoics.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hardy, Phil  |author2=Laing, Dave | title=Encyclopedia of Rock |year=1988  |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofro00hard  |url-access=registration  |publisher= Schirmer Books|page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofro00hard/page/297 297]|isbn=9780029195628 }}</ref> In mid 1970, he moved to London to further his career.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book| first= Martin C.| last= Strong| year= 2000| title= The Great Rock Discography| edition= 5th| publisher= Mojo Books| location= Edinburgh| pages= 644–645| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> 

===1972–1974: First album and collaboration with Thin Lizzy===
Later in 1972, Miller signed a solo [[recording contract]] with [[Chrysalis Records]], and recorded his first LP ''Once in a Blue Moon'',<ref>{{cite web|author= Jim Worbois|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/once-in-a-blue-moon-mw0000048589|title=Once in a Blue Moon |publisher=[[AllMusic]]| access-date=25 February 2009}}</ref> with record producer Dave Robinson. The album was an early example of [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]], and featured backing by the pub rock band [[Brinsley Schwarz]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Miller received consistently good reviews, although his [[single (music)|singles]] and albums were not [[record chart|chart]] [[hit record|hits]], [[Chrysalis records|Chrysalis]] continued to invest in his talent. In 1974 Miller sang "[[Still in Love with You (Thin Lizzy song)|Still in Love with You]]",<ref>{{cite web|author= Eduardo Rivadavia| url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/still-in-love-with-you-mt0030499824| title=Still in Love With You |publisher=AllMusic| access-date=25 February 2009}}</ref> as a [[duet (music)|duet]] with [[Phil Lynott]]; the song appeared on the [[Thin Lizzy]] album, ''[[Nightlife (Thin Lizzy album)|Nightlife]]''. Miller's second album ''[[High Life (Frankie Miller album)|High Life]]'', was produced and partly written by [[Allen Toussaint]] and recorded in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] during 1974.<ref>{{cite web|author= Jim Worbois|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/frankie-millers-high-life-mw0000602772| title=High Life |publisher=AllMusic| access-date=25 February 2009}}</ref> Although two album tracks, "Shoorah Shoorah" and "Play Something Sweet", subsequently provided hits for [[Betty Wright]] and [[Three Dog Night]] respectively, the album was not a commercial success.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===1975–1979: Subsequent albums and "Darlin'"===
Miller's next album ''[[The Rock (The Frankie Miller Band album)|The Rock]]'' (1975) was recorded in San Francisco using the producer Elliot Mazer, who had co-produced ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' for [[Neil Young]]. The next album ''[[Full House (Frankie Miller Album)|Full House]]'' (1977),<ref>{{cite web|author= Jim Warbois|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/full-house-mw0000478979| title=Full House|publisher=AllMusic| access-date=25 February 2009}}</ref> was produced by [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]]. The lead off track "Be Good to Yourself" became Miller's first UK [[top 40]] hit, peaking at No. 27 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] during June that year.<ref>{{YouTube|ZPGIQfW6lz0|Be Good to Yourself (2011 Remaster)}}</ref><ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In 1978 Miller hit the UK [[Top 40|top 10]] with the song "[[Darlin' (Poacher song)|Darlin']] ", which peaked at No. 6 on 14 October 1978.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> "[[Darlin' (Poacher song)|Darlin']] " also made the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' "Bubbling Under" chart in the US, peaking at No. 103. The next single penned by Miller "When I'm Away From You" rose to No. 42 in UK, but failed to chart in US.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

During 1979, Miller wrote the opening and closing songs on the film ''[[A Sense of Freedom]]'', as well as performing on them. He diversified into acting. During 1979 Miller starred in [[Peter McDougall]]'s TV film, ''[[Just a Boys' Game]]'', directed by [[John Mackenzie (film director)|John Mackenzie]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===1980–1993: Rock albums and "Caledonia"===
In 1980, Miller released his seventh album, ''Easy Money''. The lead single, "Why Don't You Spend the Night", was a minor hit in Australia.<ref name=aus/> Miller later re-recorded the album's closing track, "Tears", as a duet with [[Bonnie Tyler]] on her album ''[[Faster Than the Speed of Night]]'' (1983). Miller moved to [[Capitol Records]] for his next album, ''Standing on the Edge''. It was noted by ''[[Newsday]]'' as a departure from the [[R&B]] influences on his earlier releases, sounding more like the music of rock bands [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] and [[Bad Company]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Robins|first=Wayne|title=Some artistic exceptions to the rule|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/720896639/|work=[[Newsday]]|location=New York, New York|page=131|date=16 May 1982|accessdate=1 November 2022|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref>

In 1985, Miller released his final studio album, ''Dancing in the Rain''. It was produced by [[John Jansen (record producer)|John Jansen]], and like its predecessor, the album was noted for its rock influences. Mark Deming of [[AllMusic]] compared it to [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]'s single "[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted to Love]]" and said that the album sounds more "dated" than his earlier work.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dancing-in-the-rain-mw0000862346|title=Frankie Miller – Dancing in the Rain|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 November 2022}}</ref>

In 1991, Miller recorded an excerpt of "[[Caledonia (song)|Caledonia]]" for a [[Tennent Caledonian|Tennent's]] lager television advert. After a surge of requests from viewers, Miller recorded and released a full-length version as a single in 1992. It peaked at No. 45 on the UK Singles Chart.<ref>{{cite news|title=Frankie's King of the Castle!|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/809892057/|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=[[Glasgow|Glasgow, Scotland]]|page=9|date=4 March 1992|accessdate=1 November 2022|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref name=uk/> Later that same year, Miller recorded a second duet with Bonnie Tyler, titled "Save Your Love", for her album ''[[Angel Heart (Bonnie Tyler album)|Angel Heart]]''.

In 1993, Miller recorded "Why Don't You Try Me" with [[Sarah Bettens]] for the Belgian film ''[[Ad Fundum]]''. The track was produced by [[Ry Cooder]] and peaked at No. 6 on the [[Ultratop|Belgian Flanders chart]]. "Where Do the Guilty Go?", which also featured in the film, later peaked at No. 46.<ref name="BEL"/>

===1994–present: Illness, recovery and tribute albums===
In 1994, Miller formed a new band with [[Joe Walsh]], [[Nicky Hopkins]] and [[Ian Wallace (drummer)|Ian Wallace]]. He was writing music in New York City when he suffered a [[intracranial aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] on 25 August 1994. Miller was unconscious for five months, and when he woke up he found himself unable to speak or sing. He spent the subsequent years in physical rehabilitation.

In September 1998, a benefit concert was held at the [[Queen's Hall, Edinburgh]] featuring [[Jools Holland]], [[Paul Carrack]], [[Bonnie Tyler]] and a band of musicians with disabilities. The concert was filmed as part of the [[BBC Television]] documentary series ''Ex-S'' and broadcast in 1999. The episode was titled ''Frankie Miller: Stubborn Kinda Fella'', and it documented Miller's road to recovery. The episode was nominated for Best Regional Documentary at the [[Royal Television Society]] awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000571/1999/1|title=Royal Television Society, UK (1999)|website=[[IMDb]]|access-date=15 July 2022}}</ref>

A number of tribute albums have since been released, including ''A Tribute to Frankie Miller'' (2003), which features covers and duets with various artists,<ref>{{cite web|last=Sloan|first=Billy|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19494940.frankie-miller-tears-tennents-trainspotting-stars-tribute-scots-great/|title=Frankie Miller: Tears, Tennent's and Trainspotting stars in tribute to a Scots great|website=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|date=8 August 2021|access-date=15 July 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210808110525/https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/19494940.frankie-miller-tears-tennents-trainspotting-stars-tribute-scots-great/|archive-date=8 August 2021|url-status=live}}</ref> and ''[[100% Pure Frankie Miller]]'' (2014) by [[Spike (musician)|Spike]] of [[The Quireboys]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hasted|first=Nick|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/spike-100-pure-frankie-miller|title=Spike: 100% Pure Frankie Miller|date=9 September 2014|access-date=15 July 2022|work=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220715143425/https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/spike-100-pure-frankie-miller|archive-date=15 July 2022|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2006, Miller released a new studio album, ''Long Way Home'', featuring vocals extracted from demos he recorded before his brain aneurysm. The tracks were produced by [[Bill Szymczyk]], [[Will Jennings]] and [[David Naughton]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Collette|first=Doug|url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/long-way-home-frankie-miller-jerkin-crocus-review-by-doug-collette|title=Frankie Miller: Long Way Home |date=1 June 2006|access-date=2 November 2022|work=[[All About Jazz]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221102162551/https://www.allaboutjazz.com/long-way-home-frankie-miller-jerkin-crocus-review-by-doug-collette|archive-date=2 November 2022|url-status=live}}</ref> Another album, ''[[Frankie Miller's Double Take]]'', followed in 2016, featuring 19 demos remastered into duets with other artists. The album peaked at No. 11 on the [[Scottish Singles and Albums Charts|Scottish Albums Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/scottish-albums-chart/20161007/40/|title=Official Scottish Albums Chart Top 100|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=15 July 2022}}</ref>

In March 2022, Miller released the track "One More Step to the Rainbow" as a protest to the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/FrankieMillerOfficial/posts/pfbid02pTBbFndMv9hVdDsgecJQNHWCECS1KgaLqWBD8T2eCChFUS1g3PRnv4pkDsDj4M2dl|title=Facebook post by Frankie Miller|publisher=[[Facebook]]|date=10 April 2022|access-date=15 July 2022}}</ref>
