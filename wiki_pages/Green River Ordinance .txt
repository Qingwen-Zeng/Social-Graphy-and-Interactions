A '''Green River Ordinance''' is a common United States [[city ordinance]] prohibiting [[door-to-door]] solicitation.  Under such an ordinance, it is illegal for any business to sell their items door-to-door without express prior permission from the household.  Some versions prohibit all organizations, including non-profit charitable, political, and religious groups, from soliciting or [[canvassing]] any household that makes it clear, in writing, that it does not want such solicitations (generally with a "No Trespassing" or "No Solicitations" sign posted).

The ordinance is named for the city of [[Green River, Wyoming]], which in 1931 was the first city to enact it.<ref>[http://www.mrsc.org/research/libraryresults.aspx?cat=1356 MRSC Featured Inquiries, "Can a city or town enact a 'Green River ordinance' banning all door to door solicitation?"]</ref>  The ordinance was unsuccessfully challenged on constitutional grounds by the [[Fuller Brush Company]] in 1932.<ref>[http://www.loislaw.com/ogpc/login.htp?WSRet=12&dockey=13815699@FDCR&OLDURL=/gpc/index.htp&OLDREFURL=http%3A//news.google.com/archivesearch%3Fq%3D%2522Green%2BRiver%2522%2Bsolicitation%2Bwyoming%26scoring%3Da%26hl%3Den%26ned%3Dus%26sa%3DN%26sugg%3Dd%26as_ldate%3D1932%26as_hdate%3D1933%26lnav%3Dhist6 Loislaw Federal District Court Opinions FULLER BRUSH CO. v.
