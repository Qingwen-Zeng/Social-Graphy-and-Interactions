==Early life==
Cash grew up in Clement Town, Dehradun. An aunt of his, who lived in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], regularly sent the latest country music releases of the time to Cash's mother. This was the music he grew up listening to and which he loved so much that he taught himself to play the guitar and sing those songs.{{refn|name=earlylife|6=6|<ref name=weekendausmag/><ref name=cmcnoneinabillion/><ref name=canberra/><ref name=queanbeyan/><ref name=newidea/><ref name=panorama/><ref name=australian/><ref name=dailytelegraphscottjenkins/>}} Because of the dearth of other country music style [[genre]] musicians, he developed his own [[guitar]] style that encompassed playing [[bass lines]], [[rhythm]], [[finger-picking]] and lead to give a unique sound.{{refn|name=earlylife1|7=7|<ref name=weekendausmag/><ref name=cmcnoneinabillion/><ref name=panorama/>}}

While in New Delhi, he briefly dabbled in [[Indian pop]] music.
In 1996, he recorded his first Indian pop album ''Yeh Pyaar Hai'' under the [[Magnasound]] (India) label with Indian pop director and producer, [[Jawahar Wattal]]. 
This was followed by a guitar [[instrumental]] the same year called ''Film Hits on Guitar''{{refn|name=earlymusiccareer1|11=11|.<ref name=hindustantimesiwasborntosing/><ref name=asianagecashinginonmanyinfluences/><ref name=garhwalpostproudtobeanindian>Ashok P. Misra

===2003–present===

A chance meeting with Australian film producer, Colin Bromley while in New Delhi, resulted in Cash being invited to the [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]] in New South Wales, Australia. Having heard him sing, and being impressed by his musicianship, Bromley, producer/director of Sydney-based television production house, Gobsmacked and Gerry O'Leary, Gobsmacked's head of production, decided to make a film on Cash performing in the festival and see what happened there. Thus, in January 2003, Cash went to perform in the Tamworth Country Music Festival.{{refn|name=present|14=14|<ref name=bharattimesindiancowboyexcelsintamworth>"Indian Cowboy Excels in Tamworth"

In June 2005, Cash's music was recognized in the United States by the [[Country Music Association]], Nashville, Tennessee.

India is listed on the country music world map as one of the foreign territories outside the United States with a country music culture and Cash was invited as one of CMA's nominees for Global Artist of the Year Award given in recognition for furthering of country music in a territory other than the United States. While he did not win the Award, Cash's performance at The Stage on [[Broadway (Nashville, Tennessee)|Broadway]] did lead to a standing ovation led by the then chief of CMA, Ed Benson.{{refn|name=present5|19=19|<ref name=zeenews>http://www.zeenews.india.com/entertainment
