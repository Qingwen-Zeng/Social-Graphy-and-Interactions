The group's former banjo player, Joe Dean, left in March 2012 to pursue other musical interests and would later join Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluegrasstoday.com/39944/joe-dean-to-quicksilver/|title=Joe Dean To Quicksilver|publisher=Bluegrass Today, 5 April 2012|access-date=8 May 2012}}</ref> Former fiddle player Jesse Stockman left the band in early August 2011 due to a wrist injury, giving way to BJ Cherryholmes who would continue that role until September 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bluegrasstoday.com/dailey-vincent-statement-on-stockmancherryholmes/|title=Dailey & Vincent Statement|publisher=Bluegrass Today|access-date=19 August 2011}}</ref> Cherryholmes joined the Christian rock singer [[Crowder (musician)|David Crowder]] and a month later Dailey & Vincent announced that Patrick McAvinue would be the band's new fiddle player.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bluegrasstoday.com/patrick-mcavinue-to-dailey-vincent/|title=Patrick McAvinue to Dailey & Vincent|date=2016-10-31|website=Bluegrass Today|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref> In April 2018, it was announced that Jessie Baker would be leaving the band due to debilitating nerve injury in his hands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bluegrasstoday.com/jessie-baker-departing-dailey-vincent/|title=Jessie Baker departing Dailey & Vincent|date=2018-04-02|website=Bluegrass Today|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref> In May, Daily & Vincent announced that Gaven Largent would be the band's new banjo player.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bluegrasstoday.com/gaven-largent-to-dailey-vincent/|title=Gaven Largent to Dailey & Vincent|date=2018-05-21|website=Bluegrass Today|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref> Jeff Parker left in 2019 and started his own group Jeff Parker and Company.
