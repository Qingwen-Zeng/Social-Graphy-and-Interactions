'''Tigirlily Gold''', originally known as '''Tigirlily''', is an American [[country music]] duo from [[North Dakota]]. The duo consists of sisters Kendra and Krista Slaubaugh.

==History==
Sisters Kendra and Krista Slaubaugh are natives of [[Hazen, North Dakota]]. The two began performing music as teenagers and crediting themselves as Tigirlily. The two also uploaded cover songs to [[YouTube]] before moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 2017 to attend [[Belmont University]]. After graduating, they uploaded cover songs to [[TikTok]] during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], which led to them receiving attention on social media. Songwriter and record producer [[Shane McAnally]] discovered the duo and signed them to the Nashville branch of [[Monument Records]], of which he is a co-owner. Monument released their self-titled EP in 2021.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://musicrow.com/2023/03/on-the-row-tigirlily-gold-embodies-the-blonde-mentality-with-new-ep/ | title=On The Row: Tigirlily Gold Embodies The 'Blonde' Mentality With New EP | publisher=[[MusicRow]] | date=March 24, 2023 | accessdate=September 26, 2023 | author=Liza Anderson}}</ref> Also at this point, they began performing at a Nashville bar owned by [[Dierks Bentley]], and changed their name to Tigirlily Gold.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/music/country/tigirlily-gold-june-country-rookie-of-the-month-blonde-ep-1235360589/ | title=Sister Duo Tigirlily Gold Revives Girl Power Anthems on New EP: 'There's This Whole Girl Group Energy' | publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=June 23, 2023 | accessdate=September 26, 2023 | author=Jessica Nicholson}}</ref>
