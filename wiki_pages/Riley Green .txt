==Music career==

Before he was a recording artist, Green was a Division 1 FCS Quarterback on the  [[Jacksonville State University]] football team. Green was also a contestant on the [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] reality show ''Redneck Island''. He released a self-titled EP in 2013, followed by additional EPs in 2015, 2016, and 2017. In 2018, he signed to the [[Big Machine Records|Big Machine Label Group]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/riley-green-mn0003672594/biography | title=Riley Green biography | work=Allmusic | accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bigmachinelabelgroup.com/news/bmlg-records-signs-riley-green | title=BMLG RECORDS SIGNS RILEY GREEN | work=Big Machine Label Group | date=22 February 2018 | accessdate=May 4, 2019}}</ref>

Billy Dukes of ''[[Taste of Country]]'' reviewed "There Was This Girl" favorably, comparing its theme to "[[Chicks Dig It]]" by [[Chris Cagle]] and noting the more [[neotraditional country]] influence compared to Green's peers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tasteofcountry.com/riley-green-there-was-this-girl/ | title=Don't quit on Riley Green's 'There Was This Girl' [Listen] | work=Taste of Country | date=9 August 2018 | accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The song charted on [[Country Airplay]], and a music video was shot in October 2018.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tasteofcountry.com/riley-green-there-was-this-girl-video/ | title=Riley Green's 'There Was This Girl' video comes together thanks to screaming fans | work=Taste of Country | date=15 October 2018 | accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>
