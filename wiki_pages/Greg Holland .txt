[[Jorge Alfaro]] hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game for the Marlins, and Holland was replaced with [[Yoshihisa Hirano]], who allowed a walk-off sacrifice fly to [[Harold Ramírez]]. Following the blown save, manager [[Torey Lovullo]] announced Holland would no longer serve as the Diamondbacks' closer.<ref>{{cite web |title=Diamondbacks' Greg Holland: Blows fifth save |url=https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/baseball/news/diamondbacks-greg-holland-blows-fifth-save/ |website=CBS Sports}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Arizona Diamondbacks pull plug on Greg Holland as closer |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/mlb/diamondbacks/2019/07/28/arizona-diamondbacks-greg-holland-removed-dbacks-closer-role/1853028001/ |website=Arizona Central |access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref> The Diamondbacks eventually designated Holland for assignment on August 7, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=D-backs designate Holland for assignment |url=https://www.mlb.com/news/greg-holland-designated-for-assignment |website=MLB.com}}</ref> He was released on August 10.
