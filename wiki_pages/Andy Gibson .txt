He led a [[big band]] while serving in the [[United States Army]] from 1942-45.

After his discharge, he continued working with Barnet but focused primarily on [[R&B]] music. He was musical director for [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] from 1955–60 and recorded four songs as a leader in 1959 which were released by [[RCA Camden]].
