'''Upchurch''' is a village and [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] in the [[Borough of Swale|Swale]] district of [[Kent]], England. It is situated about {{convert|2|km|mi}} north of the [[A2 road (Great Britain)|A2 road]], between [[Rainham, Kent|Rainham]] and [[Sittingbourne]].

==History==
It is probable that, although today the land is low-lying and marshy, it was once higher than it is today. 

Upchurch lay on a pre-Roman trackway; the many linking roads are the result of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] occupation, which had built a community of ex-soldiers who wanted to settle in England. A Roman cemetery has been discovered here. It is also the site of several Roman [[pottery]] works. A more recent pottery was established here in 1909 called the [[Upchurch Pottery]]. It became well known and could be found retailing through such outlets as [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty & Co]]. It closed in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.studiopottery.com/potteries/upchurchpottery.html |title=Upchurch Pottery |work=studiopottery.com |accessdate=13 November 2023 }}</ref> 

The [[Upchurch Hoard]] is a hoard of well worn coins which date from the first and second century A.D. which were found close to Upchurch in 1950.<ref name=mccabe>[http://andrewmccabe.ancients.info/Hoards.html#Upchurch  Upchurch Hoard], Andrew McCabe, ancients.info, accessed June 2010</ref>

Under the [[grade I listed]]<ref>[http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-176207-church-of-st-mary-the-virgin-upchurch-ke British listed buildings] retrieved 20 July 2013</ref> 14th century church is a small [[crypt]] (a [[charnel house]]) where bones were kept when the churchyard was full. It was discovered in 1877 and the bones re-interred. The church is also notable for its very unusual 'candle-snuffer' steeple where an octagonal pyramid appears to have been stacked on top of a square one resembling a couple of inverted ice-cream cones. It is believed that the distinctive shape was chosen to serve as a navigational aid for shipping on The River Thames. The wall surrounding the church was found in 2014 also to be listed within the church grade one status.

In 2008 residents with the aid of a [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] grant collected and published a book ''Upchurch in old picture'' postcards.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gunnill |first=Mike |title=Upchurch in Old Picture Postcards |publisher=Meresborough Books |year=2005 |isbn=094819393X }}</ref> The project, to collect and maintain photographs that reflected changing village life, continues under the heading, the Upchurch Collection.

The settlement of '''Otterham Quay''' lies a mile west of the village at the head of Otterham Creek. This small port gave young Francis Drake his first experience of the sea.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bushell |first=T.A |title=Kent |publisher=County History, Barracuda Books Ltd |year=1976 |isbn=0860230139 |volume=1 }}</ref> When the last brick field was given planning permission for development, a publication ''Otterham, Kent: Your Heritage'' was produced.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gunnill |first=Mike |title=Otterham, Kent: Your Heritage |publisher=Parkers Design and Print |isbn=0993143504 }}</ref> The book wanted to record the heritage of the area ahead of new housing.

==Twinning==
Upchurch is twinned with the Commune of [[Ferques]], Pas de [[Calais]], [[France]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Atlas français de la coopération décentralisée |url=https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/cncdext/dyn/public/atlas/rechercheAtlasFrance.html?criteres.collectiviteId=29074 |website=Commission Nationale de la Cooperation Decentralisee|access-date=12 November 2023 |language=French}}</ref>
