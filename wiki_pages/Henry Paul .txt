==Playing career==
Born in [[Tokoroa]], New Zealand, Paul started playing rugby union at the age of three for [[Ponsonby Rugby Football Club]] and then rugby league for the [[Te Atatu Roosters]]. Later, during his time at [[Rutherford College, Auckland|Rutherford High School]] (1990), he led his team to break many Auckland club rugby league team and individual records. The following year, Paul moved to the [[Point Chevalier Pirates]].{{cn|date=February 2023}}

In the 1992 season he returned to Te Atatū, debuting in their senior premier team at 18 years of age, making the [[Auckland Rugby League]] Finals. That off season, Paul was selected as a utility player for the under-19 Auckland side, playing a major part in his team winning the national tournament. Following that success, Paul was selected as the [[Junior Kiwis]] [[Captain (sports)|captain]] to tour England that same off season.

Paul led by example when his team looked "out of sorts", guiding them to memorable victories against their Great Britain counterparts. His form was so inspiring that he earned full [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] representative honours on the same tour, when the senior team the (New Zealand Kiwis) hit an injury crisis on a [[1993 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France|corresponding tour of Britain]]. Paul, at just 18 years of age, made his test début as a substitute against [[France national rugby league team|France]].

===Wakefield Trinity===
Paul's form on the Junior, and then subsequently New Zealand team tour, did not go unnoticed by scouts in [[England]] and in the off season of 1993/94 he joined [[Wakefield Trinity]] ([[List of Wakefield Trinity players|Heritage No. 1052]]) of the English [[Rugby Football League Championship]].<ref name="PAUL MAY BE BACK FOR MORE">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/rugbyleague/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=rleague/08/02/22/RUGBYL_Super_Nightlead.html|title=Paul May Be Back For More|publisher=Sportinglife|date=22 February 2008|access-date=22 February 2008}}</ref>

===Return to New Zealand===
He returned to New Zealand for the 1994 season, playing five matches for the [[Waitakere City Raiders]] in the new [[Lion Red Cup]].

===Gloucester (rugby union)===
Paul spoke to [[National Rugby League]] club the [[Canterbury Bulldogs]] and [[Super 12]] clubs the [[Blues (Super Rugby)|Auckland Blues]] and the [[Waikato Chiefs]]. He was eventually tempted away from the Bradford Bulls to play rugby union for [[Gloucester Rugby|Gloucester]], by [[Philippe Saint-André]] and [[Tom Walkinshaw]].<ref name="Bulldogs withdraw Paul offer">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/1434145.stm|title=Bulldogs withdraw Paul offer|publisher=BBC|date=11 July 2001|access-date=20 February 2008}}</ref><ref name="Walker on the warpath">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/1457375.stm|title=Walker on the warpath|publisher=BBC|date=25 July 2001|access-date=20 February 2008}}</ref>

Having experimented with being a [[Fullback (rugby union)|fullback]] and [[Fly-half (rugby union)|fly-half]] he settled into the [[inside centre]] position and his long passing stood well with Gloucester's style of play.
