'''''Reckless Kelly''''' is a 1993 Australian [[comedy film]] produced, written, directed and starring [[Yahoo Serious]]. It co-stars [[Melora Hardin]], [[Alexei Sayle]] and [[Hugo Weaving]]. The story is a [[Satire|satirical]] take on a modern-day [[Ned Kelly]], a famous Australian outlaw.

== Synopsis ==
A modern-day [[Ned Kelly]] robs banks in Australia and gives all the money to the poor people. Ned is forced to go to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to make enough money to save his family's land. As it goes against his belief, he cannot simply rob banks there for his own benefit. Ned is forced to find another way to come up with the $1 million required to save his family island. That is when a movie producer shows up and gives Ned an offer he cannot refuse.

== Reception ==
Neil Jillett, film critic for ''[[The Age]]'' wrote, "There are some good gags along the way, and a few of the plot's twists have an entertainingly surreal zaniness. But there is much heavy going too. Most of the messages Serious loads into the film—protect the environment, hate violence and banks, mock the British, go for a republic, sneer at American fads and religious hypocrisy—are presented with a smugness that was missing from ''Young Einstein''".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/126085980/?terms=%22%22reckless%2Bkelly%22%2Bjillett|title=This Is Serious, Ned|last=Jillett|first=Neil|date=15 April 1993|work=The Age|access-date=6 January 2017|via=Newspapers.com}}</ref>
