'''Robert Warren Woodruff''' (born August 18, 1961) is an American television journalist. Since 1996, he has served as a reporter for [[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]]. Woodruff co-anchored ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' in 2006 with journalist [[Elizabeth Vargas]]. He was severely injured by an [[improvised explosive device|IED]] explosion during a reporting trip to [[Iraq]] that January, and he recovered over an extended period before returning to air.

==Early life and education==
Woodruff was born on August 18, 1961 in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, the son of Frances Ann (Dawson) and Robert Norman Woodruff Jr., real estate agents.<ref name="nytimes.com">[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/12/style/lee-mcconaughy-becomes-a-bride.html ''The New York Times'' wedding announcement]</ref><ref>C.B.Kirkpatrick, Historian, Bloomfield Village, Bloomfield Hills, MI.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lynchfuneraldirectors.com/death_notice.aspx?Operation%3Dpreview%26noticeid%3D3379%26AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport%3D1 |title=Death Notice |access-date=January 22, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122070523/http://www.lynchfuneraldirectors.com/%28S%28kaofmo45ynmmlc4535fxxd55%29%29/death_notice.aspx?Operation=preview&noticeid=3379&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |archive-date=January 22, 2015 }}</ref>

Woodruff graduated from the private [[Cranbrook Kingswood]] school in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan in 1979. He earned a B.A. in 1983 from Colgate University, where he played lacrosse—finishing his career with 184 points, second all-time at Colgate. Woodruff earned a J.D. from the University of Michigan Law School in 1987, and he is an alumnus of [[Theta Chi]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsmia.com/bob_woodruff/profile-38930.html |title=Bob Woodruff wiki |access-date=September 24, 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
After graduating from law school, Woodruff worked as a bankruptcy associate at [[Shearman & Sterling]], LLP in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2007/01/30/the-recovery-of-recovering-lawyer-bob-woodruff |title=The Recovery of Recovering Lawyer, Bob Woodruff |date=January 30, 2007 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal, USA}}</ref> In 1989, while Woodruff was teaching law in Beijing, China, CBS News hired him as an on-screen interpreter during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. Shortly thereafter, he left the law practice and became a full-time correspondent, initially working for several local stations.

===ABC News===
Woodruff began working for [[ABC News (United States)|ABC News]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=127761|title=Bob Woodruff|author=ABC News|publisher=ABC News, USA|access-date=May 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://abcnews.go.com/Author/Bob_Woodruff |title=ABC News Stories published by Bob Woodruff|date=January 30, 2017|publisher=ABC News, USA|access-date=January 30, 2017}}</ref> He succeeded [[Peter Jennings]] as a co-anchor of ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' in December 2005 with Elizabeth Vargas. In January 2006, Woodruff was critically wounded by a [[Improvised explosive device|roadside bomb]] in Iraq.

====Wounded in Iraq====

He suffered a traumatic brain injury and was not expected to survive. However, Woodruff recovered, and is determined to help other Americans who were similarly wounded in war.]]

On January 29, 2006, Woodruff and Canadian cameraman [[Doug Vogt]] were seriously injured in an explosion from an improvised explosive device near Taji, Iraq, about {{convert|12|mi|km}} north of Baghdad.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna11086342|title=ABC's Bob Woodruff seriously injured in Iraq|work=NBC News|date=January 29, 2006}}</ref> Woodruff had traveled with an ABC News team to Israel to report on the aftermath of the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|2006 Palestinian elections]], and then via Amman, Jordan to Baghdad, so that he could meet with troops before President [[George W.

At the time of the attack, they were [[embedded journalist|embedded]] with the [[U.S. 4th Infantry Division]], traveling in an Iraqi [[MT-LB]]. Woodruff and Vogt were standing with their heads above a hatch, apparently filming a stand-up. Both men were wearing [[Bulletproof vest|body armor]] and protective helmets at the time. Woodruff sustained [[Shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]] wounds; Vogt was struck by shrapnel in the head, and suffered a broken shoulder. Both men underwent surgery for head injuries with a joint Army and Air Force neurosurgical team at the U.S. Air Force hospital south of Balad, Iraq, located in Camp Anaconda, and they were reported to be in stable condition.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC's Woodruff, Cameraman Injured in Iraq|publisher=ABC News, USA|date=January 29, 2006 |url =https://abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=1553996&page=1}}</ref> Tom Brokaw reported on the ''Today'' show that Woodruff had a portion of his skull removed during surgery to reduce the damage from brain swelling.<ref>{{cite news |title=ABC's Woodruff Injured in Iraq|publisher=E!

Woodruff and Vogt were evacuated to the U.S. Army's [[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center]] in Germany overnight on Sunday, January 29.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC Anchor, Bob Woodruff, Cameraman, Doug Vogt, in Iraq in Stable Condition |publisher=CNN, USA|date=January 29, 2006 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/01/29/iraq.main/index.html}}</ref> On ABC ''World News Tonight'' that evening, anchor Elizabeth Vargas discussed the dangers of reporting in a combat zone. {{Wikinews|Bob Woodruff injured by improvised explosive device in Iraq}} After leaving Germany, Woodruff was treated for several weeks at [[National Naval Medical Center|Bethesda Naval Hospital]] in Bethesda, Maryland.

====Recovery from injuries====
Woodruff was kept in a medically induced coma for 36 days to assist his recovery, and ABC News temporarily assigned ''[[Good Morning America]]'' anchors [[Charles Gibson]] and [[Diane Sawyer]] to alternate duties on the evening newscast as co-anchors with Vargas. Vogt meanwhile was reported to be awake, mobile, and recovering.<ref>{{cite news |title=Changes at ABC, Where the War Is More Than News |website=The New York Times|date=February 4, 2006|url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/04/arts/television/04abc.html | first=Jacques | last=Steinberg | access-date=April 26, 2010}}</ref>

As of March 7, 2006, Woodruff's brother reported that the ABC anchor was beginning to walk, recognize friends and family, and speak in several languages. However, he struggled with [[expressive aphasia]] for more than a year after the injury.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-02-24-bob-woodruff_N.htm |title=Struggle for Words Frustrates Woodruff |website=USA Today |access-date=May 23, 2015}}</ref> Woodruff was transferred on March 16, 2006, to a medical facility closer to his home in Westchester County, New York, a sign of "continued progress in all respects", ABC News President, [[David Westin]], wrote in an email to staffers.<ref name="eandp">[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002198875 ABC's Woodruff Transferred from Naval Hospital, Making Progress] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023742/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002198875 |date=September 30, 2007 }}, a March 2006 article from ''Editor & Publisher''</ref> Westin's email noted that Woodruff was able to get around, talk to and joke with his family, but that "months of further recuperation" were required.

On April 6, 2006, ABC News released photos of Woodruff recovering at home, with a letter thanking everyone for their support and kindness during his ongoing recovery. Woodruff especially thanked the soldiers, doctors, and nurses who had saved his life.<ref>[http://blogs.abcnews.com/theworldnewser/2006/04/a_message_from_.html ABC News blogsite] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418051837/http://blogs.abcnews.com/theworldnewser/2006/04/a_message_from_.html |date=April 18, 2006 }}</ref> On December 29, 2006, Woodruff's wife, Lee, an editor at ''Family Fun Magazine'' appeared on ''Good Morning America'' to discuss family activities to celebrate the New Year. During the report, anchor [[Kate Snow]] asked Lee about her husband's condition. Lee said that Bob was doing well and was currently filming a television documentary about his experiences. She also revealed that he had been back to Iraq since the incident to visit the soldiers with whom he was traveling at the time of his injury.

====Consequences at ABC News====
''ABC World News Tonight'' remained second in the [[Nielsen Media Research]] rankings, but it had lost some ground to NBC's then first-place ''Nightly News'', anchored by [[Brian Williams]] before his ouster. [[Bob Schieffer]] on ''CBS Evening News'' also closed the gap with ABC after Woodruff's injury.<ref name="eandp" /> On May 23, 2006, Vargas announced her resignation from ''WNT'', citing her doctors' recommendation to cut back her schedule considerably due to her upcoming maternity leave and her wish to spend more time with her new baby. Gibson was then named sole anchor of the show, effective May 29, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=1993658&page=1|title=Charles Gibson Named Sole Anchor of 'World News Tonight'|website=ABC News |access-date=May 23, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306191452/http://www.abcnews.go.com/WNT/story?id=1993658&page=1|archive-date=March 6, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Return to air====
On February 27, 2007, Woodruff appeared on ''Good Morning America'', ''[[ABC World News with Charles Gibson]]'', and ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in advance of a documentary that aired on ABC later that evening. Despite having made great progress in his recovery, during an interview with Diane Sawyer, Woodruff had some difficulty remembering words and details, such as the name of the [[Vietnam War]] and the word "injury". The hour-long documentary ''To Iraq and Back: Bob Woodruff Reports'' explored the consequences of [[traumatic brain injury]] and highlighted the difficulties brain injured veterans face finding treatment—a subject that had first appeared in ''Discover'' magazine several weeks earlier,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/feb/dead-men-walking|title=Dead Men Walking|work=Discover Magazine|access-date=May 23, 2015}}</ref> and was elaborated on by ''The Washington Post'' reporters in the exposé "Painting Over the Problems at Walter Reed's Building 18".

Woodruff resumed his contributions to ''ABC World News with Charles Gibson'' the following day, February 28, with the first in a series of follow-up reports centering on the problems that wounded American soldiers are encountering in their treatment and recovery, particularly at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]]. Starting March 7, he was scheduled to begin reporting for ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' "at regular intervals".<ref>''Nightline'' email dated March 7, 2007</ref>

On July 12, 2008, Woodruff began hosting the weekly ABC News–produced newscast ''Focus Earth with Bob Woodruff'' on the [[Destination America|Planet Green]] television channel. On ''Focus Earth'', Woodruff covered the environmental news of the week, looking at subjects ranging from climate impact, environmental policy, political debate, and world events, as well as how climate change affects religious and cultural views and issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planetgreen.discovery.com/tv/focus-earth|title=Environmental News and Information - MNN - Mother Nature Network|work=discovery.com|access-date=May 23, 2015}}</ref>

In 2014, Woodruff worked with ESPN and ABC Sports as a reporter and host for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], normally alongside [[ESPN Brazil]] senior writer Rubens Pozzi.

In 2020, he started a [[National Geographic (American TV channel)|National Geographic]] show ''Rogue Trip'', with his son Mack. The show premiered on Disney+.
