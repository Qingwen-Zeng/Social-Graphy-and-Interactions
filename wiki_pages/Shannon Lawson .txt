'''Shannon Lee Lawson''' (born July 12, 1973) is an American [[country music]] artist and songwriter.

Lawson was originally signed to [[MCA Nashville Records]], which released his debut album ''Chase the Sun'' in 2002. It produced two minor chart singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, including the No.&nbsp;28-peaking "Goodbye on a Bad Day". Two years later, he was signed to [[Equity Music Group]], a label owned by singer [[Clint Black]]. Although Lawson charted two more singles during his tenure on this label, his album for Equity (titled ''Big Yee-Haw'') was not released.

==Biography==
Lawson was born in [[Taylorsville, Kentucky]] into a family of amateur musicians, all of whom frequently played sessions at home. He began to play his uncle's guitar at age four, and later got a guitar of his own, on which Lawson's father taught him country songs.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p461063/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=allmusic ((( Shannon Lawson > Biography ))) |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |last=Deming |first=Mark |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref><ref name="cmt">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lawson_shannon/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040619001019/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lawson_shannon/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 19, 2004 |title=Shannon Lawson : Biography |accessdate=August 2, 2007 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> Lawson later formed a band in high school; although the band regularly played rock music, he would regularly perform covers of [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]] as well.

He later moved to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where he attended college and joined a [[blues music|blues]] group called Top Hat, in which he played lead guitar and sang.<ref name="allmusic"/> Later, he moved on to playing as a solo acoustic act, eventually joining a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band named the Galoots.<ref name="allmusic"/> The Galoots recorded two albums independently. Soon, Lawson began writing songs for the band, with his material eventually landing him a deal with a publishing house in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

===Solo career===
Lawson left the Galoots and moved to Nashville, where he was signed to [[MCA Nashville Records]] in 2001, with his solo album ''Chase the Sun'' being released a year later.<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="cmt"/> The album's producer, [[Mark Wright (record producer)|Mark Wright]] (who has also produced for [[Lee Ann Womack]] and [[Gary Allan]], among others) allowed Lawson to use experimental instrumentation on this album.<ref name="cmt"/> For example, one of the album's tracks features mandolinist [[Chris Thile]] of [[Nickel Creek]]. The mandolin was recorded through an [[amplifier]], giving what Wright described as a "real crunchy sound, very different".<ref name="cmt"/> ''Chase the Sun'' produced two chart singles in "Dream Your Way to Me" and "Goodbye on a Bad Day", which reached No.&nbsp;45 and No.&nbsp;28, respectively, on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. He was dropped from MCA after the release of his album, however.
