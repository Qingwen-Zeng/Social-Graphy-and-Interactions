'''Sarah Jane Buxton''' (born July 3, 1980) is an American [[country music]] singer formerly signed to the independent [[Lyric Street Records]]. Between 2006 and 2008, she issued three singles from an [[extended play]] titled ''[[Almost My Record]]'', in addition to co-writing her song "[[Stupid Boy]]", which was later recorded by [[Keith Urban]].  She released her [[Sarah Buxton (album)|self-titled]] debut album in early 2010, led off by the Top 25 single "[[Outside My Window (Sarah Buxton song)|Outside My Window]]," shortly before Lyric Street Records closed.

==Biography==
Buxton was born in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. She became actively involved in music as a child by learning piano, playing flute and joining a children's choir. As she learned more about music, she became interested in songwriters and began writing poetry. After graduation, she met one of her musical idols, [[Stevie Nicks]], who encouraged her to pursue music and move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

Buxton enrolled at Nashville's [[Belmont University]]<ref name="allmusic"/> and started a Southern rock band called Stoik Oak, which toured the region for three years. After an 18-month engagement, she married Christopher Robin of the Christopher Robin Band when she was 22. However, they divorced shortly{{when|date=December 2021}} afterwards. She also felt discouraged about finding a place for her voice in the music business but found further encouragement from one of her friends, [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]] of [[Big & Rich]]. She asked her publisher to set up some co-writing sessions, and she became more confident in her approach to singing and songwriting. In the meantime, she sang [[background vocals]] for [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]],<ref name="allmusic"/> in addition to singing duet vocals on [[Cowboy Troy]]'s "If You Don't Wanna Love Me".<ref name="cbt">{{cite AV media notes

==Musical styles==
Stewart Mason of [[Allmusic]] wrote that Buxton has "an appealingly hoarse singing voice akin to [[Melissa Etheridge]] and a no-nonsense lyrical persona somewhat along the lines of [[Gretchen Wilson]]."<ref name="allmusic"/> ''Almost My Record'' received a positive review from ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' critic Michael Sudhalter, who said that "Stupid Boy" worked better from a female's perspective, and that "Innocence" was "one of the best songs about reminiscing of young love since [[Deana Carter]]'s '[[Strawberry Wine (Deana Carter song)|Strawberry Wine]]'."<ref name="cst">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/cdreview.asp?xid=3682|title=''Almost My Record'' review|last=Sudhalter|first=Michael|work=Country Standard Time|access-date=October 11, 2009}}</ref> Jessica Phillips of ''[[Country Weekly]]'' magazine wrote in her review of the album that Buxton's lyrics cast her as "a typical 20-something-year-old girl in America."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Jessica|date=February 22, 2010|title=Reviews|journal=[[Country Weekly]]|volume=17|issue=8|page=54|issn=1074-3235}}</ref>
