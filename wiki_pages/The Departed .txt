==Plot==
<!---DO NOT add further detail. Wikipedia synopsis should be simple and to the point.--->

In the 1980s in [[Boston]], [[Irish Mob]] boss Frank Costello introduces himself to a young Colin Sullivan.

Many years later, Sullivan has been groomed as a [[Espionage|spy]] inside the [[Massachusetts State Police]] (MSP) and joins the Special Investigation Unit (SIU). Another police academy recruit, Billy Costigan, is selected by Captain Queenan and Sergeant Dignam [[Cover (intelligence gathering)|to go undercover]] as a criminal.

Costigan serves a term in prison to set up his cover and further commits a series of crimes. Sullivan begins dating Madolyn Madden, a psychiatrist. Costigan catches Costello's attention, and Costello later recruits Costigan into his organization. Over the next year, Costigan becomes increasingly involved in the organization. His mental state declines but Queenan and Dignam convince him to continue. Costigan begins having appointments with Madden.

The MSP and Costello both realize that there is a mole in their respective organizations and task Costigan and Sullivan to find the moles. Meanwhile, Costigan learns that Costello is a protected [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Police informant|informant]]. Costigan shares his discovery with Queenan. Costigan and Madden have an affair.

One night, Costigan follows Costello into an [[adult movie theater|adult theater]] and witnesses him giving Sullivan an envelope containing information of his crew. Costigan is instructed to get a visual ID of Sullivan but he is unable to get a good look at his face. When Sullivan realizes that he is being followed, he accidentally stabs a man, mistaking him for Costigan, and flees. Queenan advises Sullivan to follow Costello to find the MSP mole. Costigan calls Queenan and sets up a meeting to end the undercover operation, but Sullivan has Queenan followed, lying to the other officers that Queenan may be the spy. Sullivan also calls in Costello's gang to the meeting location.

When Costello's men arrive, Queenan helps Costigan escape before being thrown from the building to his death. This causes a firefight between police and Costello's men. Angered by Queenan's murder, Dignam attacks Sullivan and is suspended. Timothy Delahunt, one of Costello's henchmen who was wounded in the gunfight, tells Costigan that he knows he is the mole before he succumbs to his wounds. Sullivan looks through Queenan's belongings and learns that Costello is an FBI informant after reading Queenan's notebook. A news report reveals that Delahunt was an undercover officer for the [[Boston Police Department]], but Costello suspects the police department made up the claim so he would stop looking for the mole. Deciding to turn on him, Sullivan directs the MSP to tail Costello, and a gunfight erupts, killing most of Costello's crew. Sullivan confronts a wounded Costello, who admits to being an FBI informant. They exchange gunfire, and Sullivan kills him.

His assignment finished, Costigan goes to Sullivan to reveal his undercover status, still unaware of the other's true identity. After Sullivan goes to another room, Costigan notices the same envelope from the theater on his desk. Costigan realizes that Sullivan was Costello's mole, and escapes. Shortly after, Sullivan returns to find Costigan gone, and realizes that he now knows his true identity. He deletes Costigan's records from police computers. Costigan visits Madden, who has revealed that she's pregnant to Sullivan but not to Costigan knowing that Sullivan may not be the father, and hands her an envelope, instructing her to open it if something happens to him. She finds an envelope in the mail from Costigan addressed to Sullivan. Inside is a CD of Costello's recorded conversations with Sullivan. Scared that Costigan has revealed their affair, she listens to the taped conversations and leaves Sullivan. Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan on the rooftop of the building where Queenan was killed, then arrests him. Costigan calls Trooper Brown, an acquaintance from the [[police academy]], but Brown pulls a gun on Costigan when he arrives, unsure who is telling the truth.

Costigan says that he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello, and Brown lets him go down the elevator. Upon reaching the lobby, Costigan is shot in the head by Trooper Barrigan, a friend of Sullivan's who reveals himself to be another spy working for Costello. Brown reaches the lobby but is shot dead by Barrigan as well. Sullivan shoots Barrigan dead, allowing him to denounce Barrigan as the mole while removing suspicion from himself.

At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan and Madden stand by his grave. As Madden silently cries, Sullivan realizes that they were involved. He attempts to talk to her, but she ignores him. Later, when Sullivan arrives home, Dignam is waiting for him inside and, after Sullivan indifferently accepts his fate, Dignam shoots him in the head, avenging Queenan's and Costigan's deaths, before he leaves. The final shot shows a rat crawling on the rail of the patio with the [[Massachusetts State House]] in the distance.

Nicholson wanted the film to have "something a little more" than the usual gangster film, and screenwriter Monahan came up with the idea of basing the Costello character on Irish-American gangster [[Whitey Bulger]]. This gave the screenplay an element of realism—and an element of dangerous uncertainty, because of the wide-ranging ''carte blanche'' the FBI gave Bulger in exchange for revealing information about fellow gangsters.<ref name=directors /> A technical consultant on the film was Tom Duffy, who had served three decades on the Boston Police Department, particularly as an undercover detective investigating the Irish mob.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emanuellevy.com/comment/the-departed-dicaprio-6/ |title=Departed, The: DiCaprio |website=emanuellevy.com |date=August 17, 2006 |access-date=February 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616143150/http://emanuellevy.com/comment/the-departed-dicaprio-6/|archive-date=June 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Julian |last=Roman |url=http://movieweb.com/matt-damon-and-leonardo-dicaprio-smell-a-rat-in-the-departed/ |title=Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio Smell A Rat in 'The Departed' |website=[[MovieWeb]] |publisher=Watchr Media |location=Las Vegas, Nevada |date=October 2, 2006 |access-date=February 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108224523/https://movieweb.com/matt-damon-and-leonardo-dicaprio-smell-a-rat-in-the-departed/|archive-date=November 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

''The Departed'' was officially greenlit by [[Warner Bros.]] in early 2005 and began shooting in the spring of that year.<ref name=filmmaker /> Some of the film was shot on location in Boston. For budgetary and logistical reasons many scenes, in particular interiors, were shot in locations and sets in New York City, which had tax incentives for filmmakers that Boston at the time did not.<ref name=directors /><ref>{{Cite news |first=Gayle |last=Fee |url=http://www.mafilm.org/2009/11/23/damon-headed-back-to-bay-state/ |title=Damon to shoot in Massachusetts again? |newspaper=[[Boston Herald]] |publisher=[[Digital First Media]] |location=Boston, Massachusetts |date=November 23, 2009|access-date=September 16, 2016 |via=mafilm.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917091437/http://www.mafilm.org/2009/11/23/damon-headed-back-to-bay-state/|archive-date=September 17, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Themes and motifs==
Film critic [[Stanley Kauffmann]] said that for ''The Departed,'' Scorsese "was apparently concerned with the idea of identity, one of the ancient themes of drama, and how it affects one's actions, emotions, self-knowledge, even dreams." Kauffmann, however, did not find the theme conveyed with particular effectiveness in the film.<ref name="Kauffmann">{{cite magazine|author=Kauffmann, Stanley|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/65026/martin-scorsese-matt-damon-leonardo-dicaprio|title=Themes and Schemes|date=October 30, 2006|magazine=[[The New Republic]]|url-status=live|issue=18|volume=235|archive-date=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221082414/https://newrepublic.com/article/65026/martin-scorsese-matt-damon-leonardo-dicaprio}}</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] compared Costigan and Sullivan's seeking of approval from those they are deceiving to [[Stockholm syndrome]].<ref name="ebert">{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=July 5, 2007|title=Good and evil, in each other's masks|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-departed-2007|work=RogerEbert.com|access-date=January 12, 2021}}</ref> Ebert also noted the themes of [[Catholic guilt]].<ref name="ebert"/>

In the final scene, a rat is seen on Sullivan's window ledge. Scorsese acknowledges that while it is not meant to be taken literally, it somewhat symbolizes the "quest for the rat" in the film and the strong sense of distrust among the characters, much like post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] U.S. The window view behind the rat is a nod to gangster films like ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931), ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), and ''[[White Heat]]'' (1949).<ref name="scor">{{cite news |url=http://www.canmag.com/news/4/3/5292 |title=Martin Scorsese Talks ''The Departed'' Rat |work=Canmag |date=October 5, 2006 |access-date=February 25, 2013 |author=Topel, Fred|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101000549/http://canmag.com/news/4/3/5292|archive-date=November 1, 2011|url-status=usurped}}</ref> The film's penultimate scene at Costigan's funeral, when Madden walks straight past Sullivan and out of camera without looking at him, is a visual quotation of the famous closing scene from ''[[The Third Man]]''.

Throughout the film, Scorsese uses an "X" motif to foreshadow death in a manner similar to [[Howard Hawks]]' film ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932). Examples include shots of cross-beam supports in an airport walkway when Costigan is phoning Sgt. Dignam, the lighted "X" on the wall in Sullivan's office when he assures Costello over the phone that Costigan is not the rat, the taped windows of the building Queenan enters before being thrown to his death, behind Costigan's head in the elevator before he is shot, and the carpeted hallway floor when Sullivan returns to his apartment before being shot by Dignam at the film's end.<ref name="ReneRodriguez">{{cite news |first=Rene |last=Rodriguez |url=http://miamiherald.typepad.com/reeling/2007/01/x_marks_the_spo.html |title=X marks the spot in 'The Departed' |newspaper=[[The Miami Herald]] |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy]] |location=Miami, Florida |date=January 11, 2007 |access-date=November 26, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126004607/http://miamiherald.typepad.com/reeling/2007/01/x_marks_the_spo.html|archive-date=November 26, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked it on its end-of-the-decade "Best of" list, saying: "If they're lucky, directors make one classic film in their career. Martin Scorsese has one per decade (''[[Taxi Driver]]'' in the '70s, ''[[Raging Bull]]'' in the '80s, ''[[Goodfellas]]'' in the '90s).

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars out of four, praising Scorsese for thematically differentiating his film from the original.<ref name="ebert"/> Online critic [[James Berardinelli]] awarded the film four stars out of four, praising it as "an American epic tragedy." He went on to claim that the film deserves to be ranked alongside Scorsese's past successes, including ''Taxi Driver'', ''Raging Bull'' and ''Goodfellas''.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |first=James |last=Berardinelli |author-link=James Berardinelli |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/departed.html |title=Review: Departed, The |website=ReelViews.net |access-date=October 17, 2009 |archive-date=November 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201121162102/https://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/departed.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Andrew Lau]], co-director of ''[[Infernal Affairs]]'', in an interview with Hong Kong newspaper ''[[Apple Daily]]'', said: "Of course I think the version I made is better, but the Hollywood version is pretty good too.

He ultimately rated ''The Departed'' eight out of ten and said that the Hollywood remake is worth a view, though according to Lau's spokeswoman Alice Tam, he felt that the combination of the two female characters into one in ''The Departed'' was not as good as the original storyline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hk.news.yahoo.com/061005/60/1u6o2.html |title=Andy Lau Gives 'Departed' an 8 Out of 10 |date=October 7, 2006 |access-date=October 7, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216120725/http://hk.news.yahoo.com/061005/60/1u6o2.html |archive-date=December 16, 2006}}</ref>

A few critics were disappointed in the film, including [[J. Hoberman]] of the ''[[Village Voice]]'', who wrote: "''Infernal Affairs'' was surprisingly cool and effectively restrained for HK action, but Scorsese raises the temperature with every ultraviolent interaction. The surplus of belligerence and slur reach near-[[Quentin Tarantino|Tarantinian]] levels—appropriate as he's staking a claim to QT's turf."<ref>{{cite web |first=J. |last=Hoberman |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-09-26/film/bait-and-switch/ |title=Bait and Switch |newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] |publisher=[[Voice Media Group]] |location=New York City |date=September 26, 2006 |access-date=November 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516185103/http://www.villagevoice.com/2006-09-26/film/bait-and-switch/|archive-date=May 16, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Canceled sequel==
Although many of the key characters in the film are dead by the end, there was a script written for a sequel. This was ultimately shelved due to the expense and Scorsese's lack of interest in creating a sequel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Martin-Scorsese-Departed-Almost-Got-Sequel-Here-Why-It-Didn-t-Happen-114897.html |title=Martin Scorsese's The Departed Almost Got A Sequel, Here's Why It Didn't Happen |date=February 27, 2016 |website=Cinema Blend|access-date=March 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323014040/https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Martin-Scorsese-Departed-Almost-Got-Sequel-Here-Why-It-Didn-t-Happen-114897.html|archive-date=March 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
