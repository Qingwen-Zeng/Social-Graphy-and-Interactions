'''''Gloriana''''', Op. 53, is an opera in three acts by [[Benjamin Britten]] to an English [[libretto]] by [[William Plomer]], based on [[Lytton Strachey]]'s 1928 ''Elizabeth and Essex: A Tragic History''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IOTuC8vd3UYC&pg=PA1 ''Elizabeth and Essex'', Google books] at books.google.com. Retrieved 23 December 2012</ref>
The first performance was presented at the [[Royal Opera House]], London, in 1953 during the celebrations of the [[coronation]] of Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. ''Gloriana'' was the name given by the 16th-century poet [[Edmund Spenser]] to his character representing Queen [[Elizabeth I]] in his poem ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''. It became the popular name given to Elizabeth I.

The opera depicts the relationship between Queen Elizabeth and the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], and was composed for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953. Several in the audience of its gala opening were disappointed by the opera, which presents the first Elizabeth as a sympathetic, but flawed, character motivated largely by vanity and desire. The premiere was one of Britten's few critical failures, and the opera was not included in the series of complete Decca recordings conducted by the composer. However, a symphonic suite extracted from the opera by the composer (Opus 53a), which includes the Courtly Dances, is often performed as a concert piece.

==Performance history==
The opera premiered on 8 June 1953 at the [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden, six days after the [[coronation of Elizabeth II]]. The performance was attended by Queen [[Elizabeth II]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] and the rest of the [[British royal family|royal family]], as well as other foreign guests in London for the coronation such as [[Sālote Tupou III|Queen Sālote Tupou III of Tonga]], [[Olav V of Norway|Crown Prince Olav]] and [[Princess Märtha of Sweden|Crown Princess Märtha of Norway]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Royal Opera Night |url=https://www.britishpathe.com/video/royal-opera-night |website=British Pathé |access-date=4 February 2021}}</ref>

On 22 November 1963, the composer's 50th birthday, [[Bryan Fairfax]] conducted a concert performance, which was the opera's first 
performance in any form since its inaugural production in 1953. When the production toured in 1954 to Manchester and Birmingham, [[Joan Sutherland]] sang the role of Penelope.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nla.gov.au/collect/prompt/sutherland.html|title = Dame Joan Sutherland / Richard Bonynge|access-date = 8 June 2008|via = [[National Library of Australia]]}}</ref> The second staging of ''Gloriana'' was undertaken by [[Sadler's Wells Opera]] in 1966 with [[Sylvia Fisher]] in the title role, directed by [[Colin Graham]].<ref>Rosenthal, p. 221</ref>

In 1973, at [[The Proms]] in London, a concert version under conductor [[Charles Mackerras]] was performed and recorded, based on Sadlers' Wells Opera's revival of the Colin Graham production, with [[Ava June]] and [[David Hillman (tenor)|David Hillman]] as Elizabeth and Essex.<ref name="Operadis">[http://www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk/CLBRGLOR.HTM#1 Information on operadis-opera-discography.org.uk] "This appears to be a recording of a concert performance given at a PROM in the Royal Albert Hall, London on 2 September 1973"</ref>

Another eleven years were to pass before a recording appeared, that of 1984 under [[Mark Elder]] by the [[English National Opera]] (formerly Sadlers' Wells Opera).<ref name="Operadis" /> This was also based on a revival of Colin Graham's production,<ref name="Amazon">[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Britten-Gloriana-Various-Elder-Blu-ray/dp/B014JUP9HK Amazon entry for the DVD recording]</ref> with [[Sarah Walker (mezzo-soprano)|Sarah Walker]] and [[Anthony Rolfe Johnson|Anthony Rolfe-Johnson]] as Elizabeth and Essex, and the production also toured to the United States in New York, New Orleans and Texas.

[[Central City Opera]] (in Colorado) presented the North American premiere production of the opera in 2001, starring [[Joyce Castle]] as Elizabeth I. The [[Opera Theatre of Saint Louis]] mounted the work in 2005, with [[Christine Brewer]] as Elizabeth I.

The [[Royal Opera House]] in London presented a performance in June–July 2013 to celebrate both the 60th anniversary of the opera, and the centenary of Britten's birth. The performance starred [[Susan Bullock]], [[Toby Spence]], [[Patricia Bardon]] and [[Mark Stone (baritone)|Mark Stone]].<ref>Rupert Christiansen, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/opera/10111461/Gloriana-Brittens-problem-opera.html ''Gloriana'': Britten's problem opera"], ''The Telegraph'' (London), 16 June 2013.

==Synopsis==
:Time: The late 16th century.
:Place: England.

===Act 1===

''Scene 1: A tournament''

Lord Mountjoy wins a [[jousting]] tournament. Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, provokes Mountjoy into fighting with him and is slightly wounded. Queen Elizabeth arrives and scolds the men for their jealousy. She requests that they attend her at court as friends. Mountjoy and Essex make peace and the crowd praise Elizabeth.

''Scene 2: The Queen's apartment, [[Nonsuch Palace]]''

Elizabeth and Cecil discuss the rivalry between Mountjoy and Essex. Cecil warns Elizabeth about the threat of another Armada from Spain and cautions her that it would be dangerous to show too much affection to the impulsive Essex. After Cecil has gone, Essex himself enters and sings to the Queen to take her mind off political problems. He asks her to let him go to Ireland to counter the rebellion led by the [[Hugh O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone|Earl of Tyrone]]. He grows impatient when the Queen shows reluctance, and accuses Cecil and Walter Raleigh of plotting against him. Elizabeth sends him away and prays for strength to rule her people well.

===Act 2===

''Scene 1: Norwich''

The Queen, accompanied by Essex, visits Norwich, and talks with the Recorder of Norwich. A [[masque]] celebrating Time and Concord is given in her honour.

''Scene 2: Essex's house''

Essex's sister Lady Penelope Rich meets Mountjoy for an illicit tryst in the garden. Essex and his wife Frances join them, and Essex denounces the Queen for thwarting his plans to go to Ireland. He, Mountjoy and Lady Rich imagine gaining power as the Queen gets older, but Frances urges caution.

''Scene 3: The [[Palace of Whitehall]]''

A ball is in progress at the Palace. Frances, Lady Essex, is wearing a beautifully ornate dress, which is much admired by members of the court. The Queen commands the musicians to play an energetic melody; the courtiers dance a set of five energetic "Courtly Dances". The ladies retire to change their linen. Lady Essex enters, wearing a plainer dress than before and tells Lady Rich that her original dress has gone missing. The Queen arrives wearing Lady Essex's dress, which is far too short and tight for her. She mocks Lady Essex and withdraws again. Mountjoy, Essex and Lady Rich comfort the humiliated Lady Essex. Essex expresses his fury at the Queen's behaviour, but calms down when Elizabeth returns, in her own clothes. She appoints Essex Lord Deputy of Ireland. Everyone celebrates.

===Act 3===

''Scene 1: Nonsuch Palace''

The Queen's maids gossip about Essex's failure to control the Irish rebellion. Essex bursts in and insists on seeing the Queen immediately, even though she is wigless and in her dressing gown. Elizabeth sadly admits to Essex that she is an old woman. She receives him kindly and is initially sympathetic to his troubles, but grows impatient as he complains about his enemies at court. When he has left, her maids dress her and make up her face. Cecil arrives and warns her that the Irish rebels and the hot-headed Essex both pose a threat to her reign. Elizabeth agrees that Essex should be kept under house arrest.

''Scene 2: A street in the City of London''

A ballad singer recounts Essex's attempts to incite rebellion, while Essex's followers try to gather new recruits. A herald announces that Essex is branded a traitor, and that anyone who supports him will be guilty of treason.

''Scene 3: The Palace of Whitehall''

Essex has been sent to the [[Tower of London]]. Cecil, Raleigh and other councillors try to persuade the Queen to sentence Essex to death, but she is reluctant. Alone, she muses on her continued fondness for Essex. Lady Essex, Lady Rich and Lord Mountjoy arrive to beg for mercy for Essex. The Queen treats the gentle Lady Essex kindly and reassures her that she and her children will not suffer. However, she becomes angry when the proud Lady Rich implies that the Queen needs Essex to rule effectively. Elizabeth refuses to listen to further entreaties and signs Essex's death warrant. Alone again, she reflects on her relationship with Essex and her own mortality.
