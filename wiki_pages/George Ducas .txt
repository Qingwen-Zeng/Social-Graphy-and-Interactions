[[Voivode]] '''George Ducas''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Γεώργιος Δούκας'', ''Geórgios Doúkas''; [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''Gheorghe Duca''; [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|old Romanian]]: ''Георге Дука;'' c. 1620 – 31 March 1685) was three times [[List of Moldavian rulers|prince]] of [[Moldavia]] (1665–1666, 1668–1672, 1678–1684), one time [[List of Wallachian rulers|prince]] of [[Wallachia]] (1674–1678) and one time Hetman of [[Ottoman Ukraine]] (1681–1683).

He was married to [[Anastasiya Dabizha]], the daughter of Prince [[Eustratie Dabija]], and later to Dafina Doamna; George Ducas fathered [[Constantine Ducas (Moldavian ruler)|Constantine Ducas]].

==First two rules in Moldavia==
[[File:Mănăstirea Cetăţuia24.jpg|thumb|The fortified palace of the monastery was destined to the lodging of the Prince. It houses a typical 17th century [[Hammam|Turkish Bath]].]]

Gheorghe Duca was of [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Albanians|Albanian]] origin and like many others of his generation who had migrated to the Danubian principalities he rose thanks to his links to other Albanians of high positions. In his youth, another Albanian, [[Vasile Lupu]] (voivode of Moldavia) took him to his court where Duca was raised.{{sfn|Wasiucionek|2016|p=106}} 

Supported by Dafina Doamna and some of the [[boyars]], he came to the throne in [[Iaşi]] after Dabija's death, but was soon ousted after his opponents appealed to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], unjustly claiming Duca's rule was corrupt.

He contracted large debts in order to reclaim the throne, which he managed to following [[Iliaș Alexandru]]'s rule. The policy of increased taxation led to the uprising of Mihalcea Hâncu in October 1671, crushed the next year after Ducas received [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] help. But, as Ducas failed to provide supplies needed for the [[Great Turkish War|War]] against the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with the [[Sultan]] [[Mehmed IV]]'s life placed in peril at the attack of [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]], the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] swiftly replaced him with [[Ștefan Petriceicu]].

==Rule in Wallachia==
In 1674, through the intervention of the [[Cantacuzino family|Cantacuzino]] boyars, he was awarded the throne in [[Bucharest]]; soon however, the alliance between the Cantacuzinos and Ducas crumbled, the prince being replaced by [[Șerban Cantacuzino]].

==Last rule in Moldavia and rule in Right-bank Ukraine==

He was soon back on the Moldavian throne, following [[Antonie Ruset]] (Rosetti)'s reign.
George Ducas had plans of extending his rule over [[right-bank Ukraine]], where [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] gains had started with the acquisition of [[Podolia]] in 1672. His overlord appointed him as hetman over the newly gained regions, in 1680 or 1681, after much [[bribery]] strained the Moldavian [[treasury]] as much as the request that Ducas had placed on the taxed categories that they contribute to his daughter's [[dowry]].

In 1683, Ducas joined the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in their march at the [[Battle of Vienna]]. Helped by his absence and aware of the complete failure of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] plans, boyars throughout the land rebelled, following Ștefan Petriceicu's command, and welcomed the invading [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Cossacks]].

On his way back, Ducas was captured on 25 December 1683 and sent to a prison in [[Poland]], where he died one year later.
