'''Raymond Kennedy''' (28 July 1951 – 30 November 2021)<ref>{{cite news |title=Ray Kennedy obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/01/ray-kennedy-obituary |access-date=1 December 2021 |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Peter |last=Mason |date=1 December 2021}}</ref> was an English [[Association football|footballer]] who won every domestic honour in the game with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the 1970s and early 1980s. Kennedy played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for Arsenal and then played as a left-sided [[midfielder]] for Liverpool. He scored 148 goals in 581 league and cup appearances in a 15-year career in the [[English Football League]]. Also, he won 17 [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s for [[England national football team|England]] between 1976 and 1980, scoring three international goals.

Kennedy turned professional for Arsenal in November 1968. He made his first-team debut 10 months later and went on to win the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in 1970, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and [[FA Cup]] Double in 1970–71, and then play on the losing side in the [[1972 FA Cup final]]. His form then declined, and he was sold to Liverpool for a club record [[Pound sterling|£]]200,000 fee in July 1974, at the same time that [[Bill Shankly]] resigned as [[Manager (association football)|manager]]. He initially struggled at the club, but after manager [[Bob Paisley]] converted him to a left-sided midfielder, he went on to help Liverpool become the dominant club in English football from 1975 to 1982. During his time at the club Liverpool won the First Division five times (1975–76, 1976–77, 1978–79, 1979–80, and 1981–82), the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] four times (1976, 1977, 1979 and 1980), the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] three times, (1977, 1978, and 1981), and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] (1976), [[UEFA Super Cup]] (1977), and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] (1981). He also picked up runners-up medals in the FA Cup (1977), UEFA Super Cup (1978), League Cup (1978), and [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|World Club Championship]] (1981) and won the ''[[Match of the Day]]'''s [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]] award in 1978–79.

He was a strong player with an excellent first touch, intelligence, and all-round ability. This allowed him to transition from a forward to a midfielder at Liverpool. Despite his trophy successes with Arsenal and Liverpool, after winning six caps for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-23]] side, he could not translate his club form into a good international career. He was used as a stand-in for [[Trevor Brooking]] before he retired from international football in frustration in March 1981. His only international tournament appearance was at [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]]. Bob Paisley described him as "one of Liverpool's greatest players and probably the most underrated".

Kennedy joined [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] for a £160,000 fee in January 1982 and added a [[Welsh Cup]] winners medal to his collection four months later. However, the effects of [[Parkinson's disease]] began to reduce his effectiveness on the [[Football pitch|pitch]], and he dropped into the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] with [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] in November 1983. During the 1984–85 season, he spent a brief time as [[Player-coach|player-manager]] of [[Cyprus]] club [[Pezoporikos Larnaca FC|Pezoporikos]] and later played for [[Northern Football League|Northern League]] club [[Ashington A.F.C.|Ashington]]. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in November 1984. His life after football was difficult, as he had to deal with the effects of Parkinson's, the loss of his business, and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage. He remained reliant on charity to fund his medical expenses and was forced to sell his medal collection and caps in 1993.

==Club career==
Ray Kennedy was born on 28 July 1951 in [[Seaton Delaval]], a former [[pit village]] in [[Northumberland]], to Martin and Veronica Kennedy, a coal miner and housewife, respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=10}}</ref> He was the eldest of four children: Trevor, Michael, and Janet.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=26}}</ref> He was spotted playing schoolboy football by a [[Scout (association football)|scout]] at [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] and began training at [[Vale Park]] after [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Stanley Matthews]] came to the Kennedy home to persuade him to sign schoolboy forms at the club.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=33}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Kennedy File|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/images/newspapers/magazines/various/raykennedy-diary.jpg|website=lfchistory.net|access-date=30 May 2016}}</ref> However, at the age of sixteen Matthews felt Kennedy was "too slow to be a footballer".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherwin|first=Phil|title=The Port Vale Miscellany|publisher=The History Press|location=Brimscombe Port|year=2010|pages=16|isbn=978-0-7524-5777-2}}</ref> Kennedy was considered to be too big and clumsy to be a professional, and groundskeeper Dennis Dawson said he was the only man at the club to see any potential in the youngster.<ref name="Tale">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Tales: A Collection Of Stories, Anecdotes And Memories|publisher=Witan Books|date=December 1991|pages=98|isbn=978-0-9508981-6-2}}</ref> The club released him after being told that he would never make it as a professional.<ref name="Tale" />

Kennedy returned to his native north-east in March 1967 and started working in a sweet factory whilst playing as an amateur for New Hartley Juniors, where he built a successful attacking partnership with former England schoolboy international Ian Watts.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=44}}</ref> The pair scored 142 goals between them and helped the club to win the East Northumberland Junior League, the Northumberland FA Junior Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Cup, the North East Youth Challenge Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Charlton Trophy, the Tynemouth Junior League Challenge Cup and the Magpie Trophy.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=45}}</ref>

===Arsenal===

Kennedy was spotted by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] playing for New Hartley Juniors. Though the scouts had initially gone to the game to watch his striker partner, Watts, Kennedy had impressed enough to win an apprentice [[Association football contracts|contract]] with Arsenal in May 1968.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=46}}</ref> He then signed professional forms with the club in November 1968.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=53}}</ref> He had a difficult task though to win a first-team place, as manager [[Bertie Mee]] used only 15 players throughout the entire [[1968–69 Arsenal F.C. season|1968–69]] season, during which time Kennedy made 20 appearances for the [[Arsenal F.C. Reserves|Reserve]] team as they claimed [[the Football Combination]] Division One title.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=59}}</ref>

He made his first-team debut on 29 September 1969, against [[Glentoran F.C.|Glentoran]] in the [[UEFA Europa League|Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=61}}</ref> and his [[Football League First Division|First Division]] debut as a [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] on 18 October, a 1–1 draw with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at [[Roker Park]].<ref name="page 64">{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=64}}</ref> He scored his first goal for the Gunners in the reverse fixture against Sunderland at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]], which ended in a 3–1 win.<ref name="page 64"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Beardsley|first1=Ian|title=Topic of the Day|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/images/newspapers/ian.beardsley/raykennedy344-arsenal.jpg|website=lfchistory.net|access-date=30 May 2016}}</ref> He went on to appear as a 77th-minute substitute in the first leg of the [[1970 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final|Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final]] against Belgian club [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] at [[Constant Vanden Stock Stadium]], and scored a late goal in a 3–1 defeat.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=65}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ray Kennedy – A Gentle Giant Remembered|url=http://goonerholic.com/2015/03/ray-kennedy-a-gentle-giant-remembered/|website=goonerholic.com|access-date=30 May 2016}}</ref> Though he did not appear in the second leg, his goal proved to be decisive as Arsenal claimed a 4–3 [[aggregate score|aggregate]] victory to win the first European trophy in the [[Arsenal F.C. in European football|club's history]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=67}}</ref>

[[Charlie George]] [[Ankle fracture|broke his ankle]] on the opening game of the [[1970–71 Arsenal F.C. season|1970–71]] season, and Kennedy replaced him as [[John Radford (footballer)|John Radford]]'s strike partner for the following game and went on to feature in the remaining league fixtures of the campaign as Arsenal went on to be crowned champions.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=68}}</ref> They exited the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup with a defeat to the German side [[1. FC Köln]] at the quarter-final stage, though after their draw with [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] in the First Round Kennedy was attacked by some of the Lazio players in an Italian restaurant, and in the ensuing brawl, police pulled a gun on teammate [[Eddie Kelly (footballer)|Eddie Kelly]]; Kennedy later said the Lazio players targeted him due to his "cheeky face".<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=73}}</ref> Back in the league, he scored his first [[hat-trick]] in victory over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. However, he admitted after the match that he was "still expecting to be dropped any minute".<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=74}}</ref> Arsenal overtook [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] to win the league title on the final day of the season, Kennedy scoring the only goal of the game with a late [[Header (association football)|header]] in a 1–0 victory over [[North London derby]] rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] at [[White Hart Lane]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=86}}</ref> In the [[FA Cup]], Arsenal progressed past [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]], [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (following a [[Replay (sports)|replay]]), [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] (following a replay), and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] (following a replay), before meeting [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in [[1971 FA Cup final|the final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. Liverpool led early in [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]], but goals from George Graham and Charlie George won the game for Arsenal. They secured only the fourth [[Double (association football)|Double]] in English football.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=91}}</ref> Kennedy had missed some good chances throughout the match, though he later pointed out that "nobody really remembers anything bad if you win".<ref>{{cite web|last1=McCluskey|first1=Robert|title=Interview with Ray Kennedy from Retro Reds|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/2443-2|website=lfchistory.net|publisher=Retro Reds|access-date=30 May 2016|date=2008}}{{Dead link|date=August 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Arsenal endured a poor start to the [[1971–72 Arsenal F.C. season|1971–72]] season, and as a result, Mee purchased [[Alan Ball Jr.|Alan Ball]] from [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]220,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=103}}</ref> They went on to go 14 games unbeaten over the winter, closing the gap on leaders Manchester City to four points.<ref name="page 104">{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=104}}</ref> They were knocked out of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] at the quarter-final stage by eventual winners [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]].<ref name="page 104"/> They ended the season in fifth place, and gifted [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] the league title by denying Liverpool what would have proved to be a decisive victory on the penultimate day of the season.<ref name="page 105">{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=105}}</ref> Arsenal returned to Wembley to defend the FA Cup, but [[1972 FA Cup final|lost 1–0]] to Leeds United; Kennedy had lost his first-team place late in the season after fatigue began to affect his form, and was only named as a substitute for the final before he came on for Radford after 73 minutes.<ref name="page 105"/> He scored 19 goals in 55 appearances to finish as the [[List of Arsenal F.C. seasons|club's top goalscorer]] for the second successive season.<ref name="page 105"/>

He struggled at the start of the [[1972–73 Arsenal F.C. season|1972–73]] season, his confidence and form suffered as defenders marked him more closely and poor diet saw his weight rise to over {{convert|14|st}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=106}}</ref> [[Captain (association football)|Captain]] [[Frank McLintock]] remarked to the management that Kennedy was only operating at 60% capacity.

Arsenal dropped into mid-table throughout the [[1973–74 Arsenal F.C. season|1973–74]] season, with McLintock's departure signalling the demise of the Double-winning team.<ref name="page 112">{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=112}}</ref> Kennedy failed to score from 6 October to mid-January, and speculation rose of possible moves to Sunderland, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], or [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].<ref name="page 112"/> In February, he released a statement saying that "my game has gone downhill since I got married but has started to pick up again now I am in bachelordom... I feel that I am better off without her".<ref name="page 112"/> He ended the season in good form, though Mee had already decided to move him on and replace him with [[Brian Kidd]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=113}}</ref>

In July 1974, Kennedy was sold to Liverpool for a [[List of Liverpool F.C. records and statistics|club record]] £200,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=114}}</ref> Manager [[Bill Shankly]] resigned on the same day as the [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] was made, though had admired Kennedy for years and stated that "maybe it will be said that one of the last things I did at this club was to sign a great new player".<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=115}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ray Kennedy switch was Bob Paisley masterstroke|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Articles/Article/2059|website=lfchistory.net|publisher=Liverpool Echo|access-date=30 May 2016}}</ref> Shortly after the move Kennedy got back in touch with his estranged wife.

Bob Paisley felt Kennedy could perform as a midfielder. After Kennedy replaced an injured [[Peter Cormack]] against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] on 1 November, he went on to make the number five shirt his own for the rest of the decade.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=136}}</ref> His new position allowed him to use his vision and distribution to create chances for his teammates whilst still allowing him to make runs into scoring positions to add goals himself.<ref name="lfchistory.net">{{cite web|title=Profile|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/Players/Player/Profile/344|website=lfchistory.net|access-date=30 May 2016}}</ref> Liverpool won the league title in [[1975–76 Liverpool F.C. season|1975–76]] with a final day victory over [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] to beat [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] into second place.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=137}}</ref> They also secured the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], knocking out [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] (Scotland), [[Real Sociedad]] (Spain), [[Śląsk Wrocław]] ([[Poland]]), [[Dynamo Dresden]] (Germany), and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] (Spain), before facing Belgian side [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] in [[1976 UEFA Cup final|the final]].<ref name="page 138">{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=138}}</ref> Liverpool were losing 2–0 in the first leg of the final at [[Anfield]] before Kennedy scored the first of Liverpool's three goals to overturn the deficit; in the return leg at the [[Jan Breydel Stadium|Olympiastadion]], Liverpool drew 1–1 to win the tie 4–3 on aggregate.<ref name="page 138"/>

Liverpool opened the new season by claiming the [[1976 FA Charity Shield]] with a 1–0 win over [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and went on to win the league largely on their home form, Kennedy's goal in a 2–1 win over title contenders [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] on 30 April proving to be decisive.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=145}}</ref> Though Liverpool failed to win any of their last four league matches, they finished one point clear of Manchester City in second.

Liverpool also reached the [[1977 FA Cup final]] but lost the chance to follow Arsenal's feat at achieving the Double as they were beaten 2–1 by [[Liverpool F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry|bitter rivals]] Manchester United.<ref name="page 150">{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=150}}</ref> In the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], Liverpool beat [[Crusaders F.C.|Crusaders]] (Northern Ireland), [[Trabzonspor]] ([[Turkey]]), [[AS Saint-Étienne]] (France), and [[FC Zürich]] (Switzerland) to reach [[1977 European Cup final|the final]] against German side [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]].<ref name="page 150"/> In the final at [[Rome]]'s [[Stadio Olimpico]], Keegan was [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)|fouled]] by Vogts and won a late [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] which [[Phil Neal]] converted to give Liverpool a 3–1 victory.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=157}}</ref>

Following a 0–0 draw with Manchester United in the [[1977 FA Charity Shield]], a disappointing start to the [[1977–78 Liverpool F.C. season|1977–78]] season saw Liverpool out of the title race early on whilst they exited the FA Cup at the Third Round. They did, though, recover to post a second-place finish in the league after winning nine of their last 12 matches to end the campaign seven points behind [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=168}}</ref> They progressed to the [[1978 Football League Cup final|League Cup final]] after Kennedy scored the winning goal past former club Arsenal in the semi-final.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dithery Ray is the Last Hero|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/images/newspapers/ian.beardsley/1978-02-07arsenalhome.jpg|access-date=30 May 2016|date=7 February 1978}}</ref> However, Liverpool lost out 1–0 to Nottingham Forest in the replay of the final at [[Old Trafford]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=169}}</ref> Despite these domestic disappointments, Liverpool went on to reach the final of the European Cup after defeating Dynamo Dresden, [[S.L.

==International career==
Kennedy won six [[England national under-21 football team|England under-23]] [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s, following his first appearance in a win over [[Wales national under-21 football team|Wales]] at the [[County Ground (Swindon)|County Ground]] on 5 January 1972.<ref>{{cite web|title=the under 23's|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/MatchRsl/MatchRslTmU23.html|website=englandfootballonline.com|access-date=29 May 2016}}</ref>

[[Don Revie]] gave Kennedy his first cap on 24 March 1976 in a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] with [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at the [[Racecourse Ground]], [[Wrexham]]; Kennedy scored the opening goal as England won the game 2–1.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=201}}</ref> However, he was never able to establish himself as England's left-sided midfielder of choice due to the form of [[Trevor Brooking]].<ref name="page 202">{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=202}}</ref> He played in [[British Home Championship]] games against Wales, [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], before he was dropped for the next seven games.<ref name="page 202"/> He travelled with the squad for the 1977 tour of [[South America]], and also that year claimed two more international goals in [[1978 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying]] games against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]].<ref name="page 202"/> He then dropped out of the England picture under new manager [[Ron Greenwood]].<ref name="page 202"/> He was named in the squad for [[UEFA Euro 1980]] in Italy, playing against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] before he was dropped for England's final [[UEFA Euro 1980 Group 2|group game]] against [[Spain national football team|Spain]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=205}}</ref> He retired from international football on 17 caps in March 1981, citing dissatisfaction with the England hierarchy.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=200}}</ref> Liverpool manager Bob Paisley wrote in his autobiography that "for England he [Kennedy] was played quite wrongly in a defensive role, being asked to pick people up. Ray closes people down by positional skill and does not need to chase around the pitch".<ref name="page 207">{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=207}}</ref> Kennedy stated that "I feel more pride in the red jersey of Liverpool than the white shirt of England" and that "I am resigning here and now as Greenwood's bridesmaid".<ref name="page 207"/>

==Style of play==
Kennedy was a strong player with average speed, good technical ability, and an excellent first touch.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=57}}</ref> Arsenal coach [[Don Howe]] compared Kennedy to [[Tommy Lawton]], and stated that Kennedy had "all the hallmarks of a classical centre forward, size, strength, bravery and skill, [[Header (association football)|heading]] ability and a powerful left-foot [[Shooting (association football)|shot]]".<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=66}}</ref> He had a good temperament and could not be provoked by harsh opposition challenges.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=71}}</ref> A psychological examination conducted on behalf of Arsenal revealed that Kennedy rated highly for his ability to respond to coaching; was rated above average for aggressiveness, determination, guilt-proneness (accepting responsibility for the team); was scored average for drive/ambition, self-confidence, emotional control, and mental toughness; and scored below average for leadership, conscientiousness, and trust.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=101}}</ref>

Arsenal goalkeeper [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]] said that Kennedy "had an alarming lack of self esteem... but there was an underlying fearsome strength, an assassin's eye and a hard-man interior".<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=102}}</ref> After Liverpool manager Bob Paisley moved Kennedy into midfield, he said that "Ray Kennedy was born to play.
