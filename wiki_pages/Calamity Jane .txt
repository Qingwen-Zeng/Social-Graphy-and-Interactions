'''Martha Jane Canary''' (May 1, 1852 – August 1, 1903), better known as '''Calamity Jane''', was an American [[American frontier|frontierswoman]], [[Exhibition shooting|sharpshooter]], and storyteller.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Fraga|first=Kaleena|date=2019-05-31|title=Calamity Jane: Hard-Scrabble Wild West Heroine Or Compulsive Liar?|url=https://allthatsinteresting.com/calamity-jane|access-date=2021-03-09|website=All That's Interesting|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=From the real Calamity Jane to 'Madam Moustache': pioneer women of the Wild West|url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/victorian/real-calamity-jane-wild-west-women/|access-date=2021-03-09|website=HistoryExtra|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-02-11|title=The Life and Legend of Calamity Jane|url=https://crimereads.com/the-life-and-legend-of-calamity-jane/|access-date=2021-03-09|website=CrimeReads|language=en-US}}</ref> In addition to many exploits, she was known for being an acquaintance of [[Wild Bill Hickok]]. Late in her life, she appeared in [[Buffalo Bill's Wild West]] show and at the 1901 [[Pan-American Exposition]]. She is said to have exhibited compassion to others, especially to the sick and needy. This facet of her character contrasted with her daredevil ways and helped to make her a noted frontier figure.{{sfn|Griske|2005|pp=83+88}} She was also known for her habit of wearing men's attire.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Life and Legends of Calamity Jane|last = Etulain|first = Richard|publisher = The Oklahoma Western Biographers|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-8061-4632-4|location = Norman, Oklahoma|pages = 42, 202}}</ref>

== Early life ==
[[File:Princeton-calamity.jpg|thumb|Marker east of Princeton indicating the most widely believed location of her birth. The site was later occupied by a [[Premium Standard Farms]] hog farm.]]
Much of the information about the early years of Calamity Jane's life comes from an autobiographical booklet that she dictated in 1896, written for publicity purposes. It was intended to help attract audiences to a tour she was about to begin, in which she appeared in [[dime museum]]s around the United States. Some of the information in the pamphlet is exaggerated or even completely inaccurate.{{sfn|Jucovy|2012|pp=47–49}}

Calamity Jane was born on May 1, 1852, as Martha Jane Canary (or Cannary){{efn|She was functionally illiterate, and the promotional pamphlet she dictated spelled her surname "Cannary" (with two N's) and repeatedly misspelled "Missourri". It also got her birth date wrong, making her about six years too old. There is ample evidence that her surname was probably spelled with only one N, including the census report of her parents when she was 4 years old.{{sfn|McLaird|2005|p=7}} It is also questioned{{by whom|date=July 2017}} whether she received her middle name Jane at birth or sometime later.{{sfn|Walker|2004|pp=200–201}}<ref name=DeadMag>{{cite web|title=Girls of the Gulch: Calamity Jane was part of the overhead|publisher=Deadwood Magazine|date=Summer 2001|url=http://www.deadwoodmagazine.com/archivedsite/Archives/Girls_Calamity.htm|access-date=March 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825230038/http://www.deadwoodmagazine.com/archivedsite/Archives/Girls_Calamity.htm|archive-date=August 25, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>|name=nb}} in [[Princeton, Missouri|Princeton]], within [[Mercer County, Missouri|Mercer County]], Missouri. Her parents were listed in the 1860 census as living about {{convert|7|mi|km}} northeast of Princeton in [[Ravanna, Missouri|Ravanna]]. Her father Robert Wilson Canary had a gambling problem, and little is known about her mother Charlotte M. Canary. Jane was the eldest of six children, with two brothers and three sisters.

In 1865, the family moved by wagon train from Missouri to [[Virginia City, Montana]]. In 1866, Charlotte died of [[pneumonia]] along the way, in [[Blackfoot, Montana]]. After arriving in Virginia City in the spring of 1866, Robert took his six children to [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. They arrived in the summer, and Robert supposedly started farming on {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of land. The family had been in Salt Lake City for only a year when he died in 1867. At age 14, Martha Jane took charge of her five younger siblings, loaded their wagon, and took the family to [[Fort Bridger]], [[Wyoming Territory]], where they arrived in May 1868. From there, they traveled on the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] to [[Piedmont, Wyoming]].

In Piedmont, Jane took whatever jobs she could find to provide for her large family. She worked as a dishwasher, cook, waitress, dance hall girl, nurse, and ox team driver.{{sfn|Griske|2005|pp=84–86}} Finally, in 1874, she claimed she found work as a scout<ref>{{Cite web|title=Los Angeles Herald |date=18 May 1902 |via= California Digital Newspaper Collection|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=LAH19020518.2.294.22&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN--------1|access-date=2022-01-23|website=cdnc.ucr.edu}}</ref> at [[Fort D.A. Russell (Wyoming)|Fort Russell]]. During this time, she also reportedly began her occasional employment as a prostitute at the [[Fort Laramie Three-Mile Hog Ranch]].{{sfn|Griske|2005|pp=84–86}} She moved to a rougher, mostly outdoor and adventurous life on the [[Great Plains]].

== Acquiring the nickname ==
[[File:CalamityJane.JPG|thumb|right|300px|1885 photos of Calamity Jane<ref>{{cite book |last=Freeman |first=Lewis R. |title=Down The Yellowstone |publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company |location=New York |year=1992}}</ref>]]
Jane was involved in several campaigns in the long-running military conflicts with Native Americans. Her claim was that:

{{blockquote|It was during this campaign [in 1872–73] that I was christened Calamity Jane. It was on [[Little Goose Creek#Route|Goose Creek, Wyoming]] where the town of [[Sheridan, Wyoming|Sheridan]] is now located. Capt. Egan was in command of the Post. We were ordered out to quell an uprising of the Indians, and were out for several days, had numerous skirmishes during which six of the soldiers were killed and several severely wounded. When on returning to the Post we were ambushed about a mile and a half from our destination. When fired upon, Capt. Egan was shot. I was riding in advance and on hearing the firing turned in my saddle and saw the Captain reeling in his saddle as though about to fall. I turned my horse and galloped back with all haste to his side and got there in time to catch him as he was falling. I lifted him onto my horse in front of me and succeeded in getting him safely to the Fort. Capt. Egan, on recovering, laughingly said: "I name you Calamity Jane, the heroine of the plains." I have borne that name up to the present time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pagebypagebooks.com/Martha_Cannary_Burk/Life_and_Adventures_of_Calamity_Jane/Life_And_Adventures_Of_Calamity_Jane_p2.html|title=Life and Adventures of Calamity Jane, by Martha Cannary Burk; Life And Adventures Of Calamity Jane Page 2|website=pagebypagebooks.com|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref>}}

[[John Wallace Crawford|"Captain Jack" Crawford]] served under Generals [[Wesley Merritt]] and [[George Crook]]. According to the Montana ''Anaconda Standard'' of April 19, 1904, he stated that Calamity Jane "never saw service in any capacity under either General Crook or [[Nelson A. Miles|General Miles]]. She never saw a lynching and never was in an Indian fight. She was simply a notorious character, dissolute and devilish, but possessed a generous streak which made her popular."

A popular belief is that she instead acquired the nickname as a result of her warnings to men that to offend her was to "court calamity". It is possible that "Jane" was not part of her name until the nickname was coined for her.{{sfn|Walker|2004|pp=200–201}} It is certain, however, that she was known by that nickname by 1876, because the arrival of the Hickok [[wagon train]] was reported in Deadwood's newspaper, the ''Black Hills Pioneer'', on July 15, 1876, with the headline: "Calamity Jane has arrived!"{{sfn|McLaird|2005|p=58}}

Another account in her autobiographical pamphlet is that her detachment was ordered to the [[Big Horn River]] under General Crook in 1875. She swam the [[Platte River]] and travelled {{convert|90|mi|km}} at top speed while wet and cold in order to deliver important dispatches. She became ill afterwards and spent a few weeks recuperating. She then rode to [[Fort Laramie]] in Wyoming and joined a wagon train headed north in July 1876. The second part of her story is verified. She was at Fort Laramie in July 1876, and she did join a wagon train that included Wild Bill Hickok. That was where she first met Hickok, contrary to her later claims, and that was how she happened to come to Deadwood.{{sfn|Jucovy|2012|p=23}}

== Deadwood and Wild Bill Hickok ==
Calamity Jane accompanied the [[Newton–Jenney Party]] into [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] in 1875, along with [[California Joe Milner|California Joe]] and [[Valentine McGillycuddy]]. In 1876, Calamity Jane settled in the area of [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], in the Black Hills. There she became friends with [[Dora DuFran]], the Black Hills' leading [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]], and was occasionally employed by her.

=== McCormick claim ===
On September 6, 1941, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Public Welfare]] granted old age assistance to a Jean Hickok Burkhardt McCormick who claimed to be the legal offspring of Martha Jane Canary and [[James Butler Hickok]]. She presented evidence that Calamity Jane and Wild Bill had married at Benson's Landing, [[Montana Territory]] (now [[Livingston, Montana]]) on September 25, 1873. The documentation was written in a Bible and presumably signed by two ministers and numerous witnesses. However, McCormick's claim has been vigorously challenged because of a variety of discrepancies.<ref name=DeadMag /><ref name="McLaird 1995 20-35">{{cite journal|author=McLaird, James D.| title=Calamity Jane's Diary and Letters: Story of a Fraud| journal=Montana: The Magazine of Western History|volume= 45, nr. 4 |date= Autumn–Winter 1995| pages= 20–35}}</ref>

McCormick later published a book with letters purported to be from Calamity Jane to her daughter. In them, Calamity Jane says she had been married to Hickok and that Hickok was the father of McCormick, who was born September{{nbsp}}25, 1873, and was placed for adoption with a Captain Jim O'Neil and his wife.<ref>{{cite book|editor= McCormick, Jean Hickok|title=Copies of Calamity Jane's Diary and Letters, Taken From the Originals Now on Exhibit at the Western Trails Museum, Billings, Montana|date= c. 1949|url= http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/010744788|publisher=Western Trails Museum}}</ref> During this period, Calamity Jane was allegedly working as a scout for the army,<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Life and Legends of Calamity Jane|last = Etulain|first = Richard|publisher = The Oklahoma Western Biographies|year = 2014|isbn = 978-0-8061-4632-4|location = Normon, Oklahoma|pages = 50–51}}</ref> and at the time of Hickok's death, he had recently married Agnes Lake Thatcher.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}<ref>Snodgrass, M.

Routledge.</ref>

Calamity Jane does seem to have had two or four daughters, although the father's identity is unknown. In the late 1880s, Jane returned to Deadwood with a child who she said was her daughter. At Jane's request, a benefit was held in one of the theaters to raise money for her daughter's education in St. Martin's Academy at [[Sturgis, South Dakota]], a nearby Catholic boarding school. The benefit raised a large sum; Jane got drunk and spent a considerable portion of the money that same night and left with the child the next day.

Estelline Bennett was living in Deadwood at that time and had spoken briefly with Jane a few days before the benefit. She thought that Jane honestly wanted her daughter to have an education and that the drunken binge was just an example of her inability to curb her impulses and carry through long-range plans (which Bennett saw as typical of Jane's class). Bennett later heard that Jane's daughter did "get an education, and grew up and married well".<ref>Estelline Bennet, Old Deadwood Days, pp. 229–232, 240–242. Quote from p. 242. Lincoln Nebraska & London: Bison Books, University of Nebraska Press, 1982. Reprint of J. H. Sears edition (New York), 1928.</ref>

=== After the death of Wild Bill Hickok ===
Jane also claimed that, following Hickok's death, she went after his murderer [[Jack McCall]] with a [[meat cleaver]] because she had left her guns at her residence. Following McCall's execution for the crime, Jane continued living in the Deadwood area for some time, and at one point, she helped save numerous passengers in an overland [[stagecoach]] by diverting several [[Plains Indians]] who were in pursuit of the vehicle. Stagecoach driver John Slaughter was killed during the pursuit, and Jane took over the reins and drove the stage on to its destination at Deadwood.<ref name="CJ_bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/cana-mar.htm|website=lkwdpl.org|title=Martha Jane 'Calamity Jane' Canary biography|access-date=July 18, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902201552/http://www.lkwdpl.org/wihohio/cana-mar.htm|archive-date=September 2, 2006|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In late 1876 or 1878, Jane nursed the victims of a [[smallpox]] epidemic in the Deadwood area.<ref>{{cite book |first=Estelline |last=Bennett|title= Old Deadwood Days|location= Lincoln |publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year= 1982|pages=222–224}}</ref>

== Final years ==

In 1881, Jane bought a ranch west of [[Miles City, Montana]], along the [[Yellowstone River]], where she kept an inn. According to one version of her life, she later married Clinton Burke from Texas and moved to [[Boulder, Montana|Boulder]], where she once again made an attempt in the inn business.

In 1893, Calamity Jane started to appear in ''[[Buffalo Bill's Wild West]]'' show as a storyteller. She also participated in the 1901 [[Pan-American Exposition]].

Her addiction to liquor was evident even in her younger years. For example, on June 10, 1876, she rented a horse and buggy in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]] for a one-mile joy ride to Fort Russell and back, but she was so drunk that she passed right by her destination without noticing it and finally ended up about {{convert|90|mi|km}} away at Fort Laramie.{{sfn|Griske|2005|pp=87–88}}

==Death==
Jane returned to the Black Hills in the spring (April/May) of 1903, where brothel owner Madame Dora DuFran was still running her business. For the next few months, Jane earned her keep by cooking and doing the laundry for Dora's girls in [[Belle Fourche, South Dakota|Belle Fourche]]. In late July, Jane traveled by ore train to [[Terry, South Dakota]], a small mining village near Deadwood. It was reported that she had been drinking heavily while on board the train and had fallen ill. The conductor, S. G. Tillett, carried her off the train,<ref>{{cite web|last1=S. G.

Jane's condition deteriorated quickly, and she died at the hotel on Saturday, August 1, 1903, from inflammation of the bowels and [[pneumonia]].<ref name=DeadMag />

A bundle of unsent letters to her daughter were allegedly found among Jane's few belongings. Composer [[Libby Larsen]] set some of these letters to music in an [[art song]] cycle called ''Songs from Letters'' (1989). The letters were made public by Jean McCormick as part of her claim to be the daughter of Jane and Hickok, but their authenticity is not accepted by some, largely because <!---hiding the following because it is incomprehensible: there is no non-McCormick document supposedly written by Jane, and---> there is ample evidence that Jane was functionally illiterate.<ref name="McLaird 1995 20-35" />

Not just old friends, but the morbidly curious and many who would not have acknowledged Calamity Jane when she was alive, overflowed the First Methodist Church for the funeral services on August 4 and followed the hearse up the steep winding road to Deadwood's boot hill".<ref name=DeadMag />

=== Literature ===

==== Books ====
Calamity Jane was an important fictional character in the ''[[Deadwood Dick]]'' series of dime novels, beginning with the first appearance of Deadwood Dick in ''[[Beadle's Half-Dime Library]]'' issue #1 in 1877. This series, written by [[Edward Wheeler (novelist)|Edward Wheeler]], established her with a reputation as a Wild West heroine and probably did more to enhance her familiarity to the public than any of her real life exploits. There is no evidence that she was consulted by Wheeler or approved the Deadwood Dick stories, so the character in the stories was entirely fictitious—as were the events described—but the fictional adventures were muddled in the public mind with the real Jane.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Calamity Jane was the title character in a serial published in ''[[Street & Smith|New York's Street & Smith's Weekly]]'' (1882) under the title, ''Calamity Jane: Queen of the Plains'', by the author "Reckless Ralph".

The science fiction writer [[A. Bertram Chandler]] included a character named Calamity Jane Arlen in his far future novels set on the frontier Rim Worlds, a space analogue of the [[Old West]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wowio.com/users/product.asp?BookId=4637 |title=The Rim of Space by A.
